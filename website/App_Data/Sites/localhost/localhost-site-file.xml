      <LocationBody>&lt;h2&gt;The Mechanics of Project Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management is getting work done through others. It is often not characterized as &amp;quot;real work&amp;quot;. However, anyone who has experienced bad management will tell you, this could not be further from the truth. This website is dedicated to providing someone who finds themselves in the role of Project Manager with the primary tools and techniques necessary for achieving well-managed projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Successful project management is part &amp;quot;art&amp;quot; and part &amp;quot;mechanics&amp;quot;. &lt;strong&gt;Project Mechanics &lt;/strong&gt;are objective and relatively easy to describe, whereas the art of project management is left to each individual&amp;#39;s interpretation.&amp;nbsp;However, Project Mechanics are tasks that simply must be carried out to ensure project success. The level of detail associated with each task is determined on a project-by-project basis, but the fundamental steps must be followed. It is important to note, however, that simply mechanically performing tasks will not ensure project success. The tasks and procedure framework described are only a foundation for project success - not a guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;True project success relies less on &lt;strong&gt;project mechanics&lt;/strong&gt; and more about the art that is the subjective side of Project Management. At the core of this subjective area is the art of effective communications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More than any other soft skill, a Project Manager must learn to effectively communicate with&amp;nbsp;the three Project consistencies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Client - who is receiving the output of the project,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Staff - who is performing the steps necessary to complete the project object, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Management - the folks paying for the project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On these&amp;nbsp;pages you will find guidelines, tools, and reference materials, but it is ultimately up to each project manager to create an effective communication and management style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that project management is the discipline of planning, organizing, and managing resources to bring about the successful completion of specific project goals and objectives. The Project Manager has the responsibility of leading the team to success. Both client and Company personnel will look to the project managers for leadership throughout the project life cycle. Mastering project mechanics, determining their appropriate application, and effective communications with all parties involved is the challenge facing every project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project work&lt;/strong&gt; is about managing and participating in projects from concept to operational use. Topics include techniques of project scope, work breakdown analysis, task estimating and scheduling, and resource, risk and cost management. The human aspects of project work, teams and communication are addressed as are quality assurance and quality standards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Project Management Professional - PMP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know that you have a project, you need to find someone to make it happen.&amp;nbsp; A &lt;strong&gt;project manager&lt;/strong&gt; is the person who is uniquely responsible for the execution and success of the project. PMI says it best in the 2000 edition of A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK&amp;reg; Guide):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to a broad range of activities in order to meet the requirements of a particular project. Project management is comprised of five processes - Initiating, Planning, Executing, Controlling, and Closing - as well as nine knowledge areas. These nine areas center on management expertise in Project Integration, Project Scope, Project Time, Project Cost, Project Quality, Project Human Resources, Project Communications, Project Risk Management and Project Procurement.{1}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;The following approaches to conflict management were introduced by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Follett" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Parker Follett &lt;/a&gt;in her Constructive Conflict publication in 1926.&amp;nbsp; Despite the 80+ years that have elapsed since then, these approaches are relevant today.&amp;nbsp; These &lt;strong&gt;5 approaches to conflict&lt;/strong&gt; each have a time and place, but in most cases the ultimate goal is to achieve a &lt;strong&gt;consensus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Avoidance Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay out of conflict; remain neutral on issues. &amp;nbsp;Employed by individuals that do not have enough invested in the issue to see value in the conflict. &amp;nbsp;Often used when the conflict is not critical or is perceived to be beyond their capacity to manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="4" style="width:100%" summary="When to use and how to respond to the avoidance approach"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Respond:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Minor conflicts where team members have already begun to formulate constructive resolutions.&amp;nbsp;Managers may not add value to all conflicts, and may foster greater leadership in team members by allowing these members to resolve conflicts.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Find potential &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; for these individuals.&amp;nbsp;Provide incentive to engage them in the process of resolution.&amp;nbsp; Avoidance is usually detrimental in obtaining valuable resolution to conflict.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Domination Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remain singularly focused on one resolution to a conflict. &amp;nbsp;These individuals will not readily yield and often fail to recognize the value of alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="4" style="width:100%" summary="When to use and how to respond to the domination approach"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Respond:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Only when project success depends on the outcome. &amp;nbsp;Domination will not build good relationships and will leave sole accountability for outcome upon the Manager.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Remain focused on the real objectives and put conflict into perspective. &amp;nbsp;Identify the merits of the dominator&amp;rsquo;s position, and seek to demonstrate places where their position complies with conflicting ideas. &amp;nbsp;Let them recognize that they can &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; without others losing.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Accommodation Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Entirely yielding to the conflicting point of view. &amp;nbsp;Seeking to preserve personal relationships even when it does benefit project tasks and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="4" style="width:100%" summary="When to use and how to respond to the accommodation approach"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Respond:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Should only be used infrequently, and on issues of little relevance to the project success. &amp;nbsp;Can be used as a tool of diplomacy with client sponsors on minor issues, but should never be used on any significant issue.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Emphasize the significance of project objectives, and demonstrate solutions where by personal relationships can benefit from the continued success of the project.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Compromise Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumes that no solution can be achieved that will yield complete satisfaction for all participants involves.&amp;nbsp;Attempts to balance personal relationships and project success when one or both may be compromised in the conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="4" style="width:100%" summary="When to use and how to respond to the compromise approach"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Respond:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Is appropriate when the effort involved in resolving differences is not worth the time it will take. &amp;nbsp;This approach only applies when each participant has a fundamentally valid position and the differences are not significant.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Determine whether a true consensus can be achieved.&amp;nbsp;If so, reinforce through merits of their position and constructively guide the conflict into a free communicating environment where the consensus can be pursued.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Consensus Approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutual agreement and understanding between all conflicting parties. &amp;nbsp;Leads to project success while simultaneously reinforcing personal relationships. &amp;nbsp;Is often the lengthiest resolution to a conflict, but produces the most favorable results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table align="left" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="4" style="width:100%" summary="When to use and how to respond to the consensus approach"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When to use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Respond:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;For all major conflicts seek to build consensus.&amp;nbsp;It yields the strongest buy-in for all parties involved and typically produces the strongest solution.&amp;nbsp;Only when decisions must be made in a very short time frame should Managers avoid consensus.&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Encourage consensus, even in relatively minor conflicts.&amp;nbsp;The potential synergistic value is worth the additional time it takes to yield a true consensus.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any group&amp;quot;s goal should be to reach decisions that best reflect the thoughts of all group members.&amp;nbsp;This approach is called &amp;quot;reaching consensus&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;However, many people use this phrase without an understanding of its true meaning.&amp;nbsp;It is easy to be confused about what consensus is and is not, so here are some guidelines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consensus Is:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Finding a proposal acceptable enough that all members can support it; no member opposes it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consensus Is &lt;strong&gt;Not&lt;/strong&gt;:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;A Unanimous Vote --- a consensus may not represent everyone&amp;quot;s first priorities.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;A Majority Vote --- in a majority vote, only the people in the majority gets something they are happy with; people in the minority may get something they don&amp;quot;t want at all, which is not what consensus is all about.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Everyone Totally Satisfied.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consensus &lt;strong&gt;Requires&lt;/strong&gt;:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Time &amp;amp; active participation of all group members&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Skill in communication: listening, conflict resolution, discussion facilitation&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Creative thinking and open-mindedness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tools for Conflict Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, consensus is the best tool for conflict management, and for even moderately important conflicts Project Managers should consider reaching a consensus as opposed to any other approach.&amp;nbsp;So how does one seek to achieve consensus?&amp;nbsp;Below is a set of tools and techniques that will aid project managers in achieving a successful consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Assume the Role of Facilitator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In nearly every situation a facilitator is required to bridge the gaps between participants in a conflict and provide open lines of communications.&amp;nbsp;Even when the conflict is between the Project Manager and other team members or client personnel, the Project Manager can potentially serve as a facilitator, but in some cases it may be more beneficial to call on an outside source to facilitate more serious conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Identify Common Ground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In most cases, participants in a conflict share common objectives, but do not recognize that others share many of the same ideas and convictions.&amp;nbsp;Conflict may often be over a very isolated detail or subsection of the bigger picture.&amp;nbsp;Start by highlighting where viewpoints are shared and build a foundation of assumptions and objectives that are shared between involved parties.&amp;nbsp;This effort will isolate the points of contention and put them into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fully Analyze Each Position&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outline the position of each side to the conflict and systematically discuss resolutions on each point.&amp;nbsp;Consensus can only be achieved when all involved parties are satisfied their thoughts have been understood, and can agree on the resolution to individual points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict&lt;/strong&gt; is inevitable in a&amp;nbsp;team environment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Project teams bring together a variety of personality and skills, each perceiving tasks and actions is in different ways.&amp;nbsp;This diversity is what gives the team depth and broad range of skills required to successfully achieve the project objectives.&amp;nbsp;Yet, this diversity will inevitably bring conflicts ranging from simple disagreements on task details to fundamental personality clashes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project manager&amp;#39;s job is to bring a team together to accomplish a defined goal.&amp;nbsp;In the course of persuing the goal, conflict is inevitable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict&lt;/strong&gt; is&amp;nbsp;the discrepancy between what is the perceived reality of the situation and what the is seen as the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key for good Project Management is to recognize that conflicts will occur between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Team members&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Team members and the Project Manager&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Manager and the project sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project sponsors and the team members&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great deal of this conflict is actually healthy and will allow participants to expand their understanding of issues and tasks.&amp;nbsp;By encouraging &lt;strong&gt;consensus&lt;/strong&gt;, Project Managers can increase buy-in from the client and team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Managers must consider two aspects of any conflict to successfully mange conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The affect of conflict on the personal relationship between participants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The affect conflict will have on the tasks being performed on the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to foster strong relationships between participants and promote the continued progress toward project objectives, Project Managers will need to employ a variety of &lt;a href="/community-building/resources/conflict-management/conflict-resolution-techniques"&gt;conflict resolution styles&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Managers will also need to recognize the type of style other project participants are employing in order to identify the common ground between individuals involved in a conflict.&amp;nbsp;Each style has its time and place, but in most cases the ultimate goal is to achieve a consensus on issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Common Causes of Project Conflict&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality Conflict (Team Member to Team Member)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conflicts range from minor differences that reduce team members&amp;#39; ability to operate efficiently together, to major conflicts that leave team members&amp;#39; unable to work together on the same project (subsequently affecting all team members).&amp;nbsp; Resolution should be sought swiftly and conducted privately if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minor Conflict&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; -&amp;nbsp;Counsel team members to find common ground and work to build a consensus for the best remedy to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moderate Conflict &amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Counsel team members, and if necessary, separate team members to the degree possible.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Major Conflict -&lt;/em&gt;If the project size permits; the manger may completely separate the team members in conflict.&amp;nbsp; If this approach is not realistic, it may be necessary to remove one of the team members.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases it is important to recognize the potential impact of personality conflicts.&amp;nbsp; You may not empathize with the your team members&amp;#39; differences, but their differences can often have a dramatic effect on performance.&amp;nbsp; Always seek to facilitate discussion on conflicts and find a solution that strikes the balance between the project&amp;#39;s goals and the personal needs of the team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality Conflict (Team Member to Client)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only difference in dealing with team member conflicts when client personnel are involved is that there is less autonomy in the solution formulation process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style-type:circle"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the Project Manager has a sufficiently strong relationship with the client personnel involved it may be appropriate to discuss the issue fully and reach a consensus with the involved parties.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the appropriate relationship does not exists with the client personnel, or the conflict is too serious for a simple consensus resolution, the Manager will need to either:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Influence the troubled team member to accommodate the client representative(s) in the interest of the project objectives (bad approach for maintaining team member&amp;rsquo;s satisfaction).&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Find tasks for the team member that will separate the two parties.&amp;nbsp; (Evaluate whether this approach will satisfy the client as well)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;In more serious cases it may be necessary to remove the team member from the project.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Work with the appropriate client management representative(s) to create an appropriate resolution&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts with client personnel can easily weaken Company&amp;#39;s relationship with the client, and these conflicts should be resolved swiftly and diplomatically.&amp;nbsp; It is a judgment call for Project Managers as to whether they seek to resolve these conflicts through direct discussion with the client, or working to simply make adjustments to the team.&amp;nbsp; It entirely depends on the type of relationship that Company (specifically the Project Manager) has with the troubled client personnel and related client management personnel.&amp;nbsp; As with any conflict situation, do not let the situation fester and grow into an increasingly intense problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality Conflict (Project Manager to Client)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of a Project Manager&amp;rsquo;s relationship with the client may involve a certain level of conflict, but this conflict should never be more than simple disagreements upon which the Project Manager quickly seeks to build a consensus resolution.&amp;nbsp; Be conscious to never leave meetings or discussions without reaching at least an initial level of consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the Project Manger&amp;rsquo;s job is to deliver messages that are painful in nature.&amp;nbsp; Seek to reduce conflict, but accept that it will occur and deliver appropriate responses.&amp;nbsp; Typically, preparing oneself with all of the appropriate information will minimize most conflict.&amp;nbsp; Avoiding all conflict will ultimately result in overall project failure and often litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the primary reasons for this handbook is to provide Project Managers with the tools and techniques necessary to ensure project success.&amp;nbsp; Conflicts with clients often arise because of &amp;ldquo;surprises&amp;rdquo; associated with scope, time, and money.&amp;nbsp; Being prepared with comprehensive information and consistently communicating serves as the foundation for addressing personality conflicts with client/management personnel.&amp;nbsp; A well-run project reduces personality conflicts to childish annoyances.&amp;nbsp; Enforcing solid project management standards provides the Project Manager the moral high ground from which to effectively operate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the role of a Project Manager is to buffer Company personnel from aberrant client personnel.&amp;nbsp; Often this role requires a high-level of tolerance and level-headedness.&amp;nbsp; Always deliver difficult messages, but be prepared with substantiation for your case.&amp;nbsp; Maintain a thick skin, but do not accept &amp;ldquo;abuse&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; If you inform an &amp;ldquo;abusive&amp;rdquo; client representative to stop and they do not, take your case to their superior and provide substantiation for your position.&amp;nbsp; If this action does not render a successful conclusion, do not hesitate to ask for assistance from other Company management personnel.&amp;nbsp; Accept that some level of conflict is inevitable, but again; do not accept &amp;ldquo;abuse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor Performance (Company Team Member)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolutions put forth below for dealing with poor performance assume that the team member involved actually has the capacity to perform at higher level.&amp;nbsp; Thus, the Project Manager must seek to identify the factors contributing to the performance gap, and act quickly to address these factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify factors contributing to poor performance.&amp;nbsp; Possible sources include:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Outside personal issues&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Team conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Dissatisfaction with role&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Substance abuse&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Chronic illness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Discuss performance and potential factors with the troubled team member&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Formulate a plan for addressing the performance gap&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Monitor the team member, and update status of the issue(s) with the team member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If poor performance persists, remove the individual from the role that they are not successfully performing.&amp;nbsp; If their performance is specific to the tasks they currently find challenging, then work to have them assigned to projects and tasks that they have demonstrated a capacity to perform.&amp;nbsp; However, if the individual is fundamentally ill suited for consulting tasks, it is the Project Manager&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to advise the team member and the company leadership that the individual is not suited for work at Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poor Performance (Client Team Member)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When client team members exhibit poor performance, Company Project Managers will likely not have the authority to investigate the contributing factors or make the appropriate recommendations to the individuals.&amp;nbsp; However, do not allow the poor performance of a client team member to affect the project time line without immediately bringing the issue to the client sponsor&amp;rsquo;s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prepare for discussions with the client sponsor, the Project Manager must compile a performance log with specific examples of the problematic behavior.&amp;nbsp; It is not only important to document the aberrant behavior, it is also important to document any attempts at rectification.&amp;nbsp; Being thoroughly prepared before any formal discussions with the client project sponsor increases the likelihood of an acceptable solution to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If factors are within the control of the Project Manager, make adjustments as necessary and continue to monitor the team member&amp;rsquo;s performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If factors are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; within the Project Manager&amp;rsquo;s control, refer the issue to the appropriate client management personnel and mutually discuss the issue.&amp;nbsp; Work to formulate a solution that will not disrupt the project time line.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the troubled individual consistently performs inadequately even after addressing the contributing factors, then it will be necessary to remove the individual from the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Managers should make it clear to the client project sponsors that Company cannot complete the project as agreed without the removal of the individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dating Between Team Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company has no official policy on &amp;ldquo;dating&amp;rdquo; within the company, but dating between project members/sponsors within the project environment can be extremely problematic.&amp;nbsp; The problems are particularly acute when one involved party has authority over the other.&amp;nbsp; From the perspective of the other team members, dating can lead to questions of favoritism.&amp;nbsp; From the perspective of the Project Manager, dating can lead to friction in the case of relationship termination.&amp;nbsp; Project Managers should make it clear that dating is forbidden between team members, else the stability and integrity of the team will likely be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Avoid staffing any Company personnel on the same project when those individuals are involved in a relationship.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Forbid dating of team member from the outset of the project.&amp;nbsp; (Include a statement on &amp;ldquo;Dating&amp;rdquo; in the Project Policy and Procedure database)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For team members that break this rule, meet with the privately to discuss the issue and formulate a reprimand as appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Remove team member from position of authority when that individual is dating subordinate team member.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;As a project manager, one of your key responsibilities is to ensure that your team members are clear on their roles and responsibilities within the project. Defining these roles and responsibilities can help prevent conflicts from arising, and can also help ensure that the project stays on track and is completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lack of clearly defined roles and responsibilities can lead to a number of conflicts within a team. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Team members may overlap or duplicate each other&amp;#39;s work, leading to confusion and inefficiency&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Team members may be unclear on who is responsible for certain tasks, leading to delays and missed deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Team members may feel that their work is not valued or recognized, leading to resentment and morale issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid these conflicts, it&amp;#39;s important for project managers to establish clear roles and responsibilities for each team member. Here are a few steps you can take to do this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define the project&amp;#39;s goals and objectives: The first step in establishing roles and responsibilities is to be clear on what the project is trying to achieve. This will help you determine which tasks are most important and who is best suited to take them on.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identify the skills and expertise of your team members: Consider the skills and expertise of each team member and assign tasks that match their strengths and capabilities. This will help ensure that the right person is doing the right job.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Communicate roles and responsibilities clearly: Make sure to clearly communicate the roles and responsibilities of each team member to the team. This can be done through team meetings, written documents, or both.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Review and revise roles and responsibilities as needed: As the project progresses, it&amp;#39;s important to regularly review and revise roles and responsibilities as needed. This can help ensure that the team is operating efficiently and effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these steps, project managers can help prevent conflicts within their teams and ensure that the project stays on track. By establishing clear roles and responsibilities, project managers can help their teams work together more effectively and achieve their project goals.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Delivering regular project status reports is an important part of project management, as it helps to keep stakeholders informed about the progress of the project and any potential issues or concerns. Here are some best practices for delivering project status reports:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Set clear expectations: Before you start delivering project status reports, it&amp;#39;s important to establish clear expectations with stakeholders. This includes agreeing on the frequency of the reports, the format and content of the reports, and the audience for the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Use a consistent format: Consistency is key when it comes to project status reports. Use a consistent format for each report, and make sure that the report includes all of the necessary information, such as a summary of the project&amp;#39;s progress, a list of completed tasks, a list of outstanding tasks, and any issues or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Use visual aids: Project status reports can sometimes be dense and difficult to digest, especially if they include a lot of data and numbers. Consider using visual aids, such as graphs, charts, and tables, to make the information more accessible and easier to understand.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Focus on key messages: A project status report should not be a comprehensive update on every aspect of the project. Instead, focus on the key messages that you want to convey, and provide just enough detail to support those messages.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Be transparent and honest: A project status report is not a marketing document &amp;ndash; it&amp;#39;s a report on the current state of the project. Be transparent and honest in your reporting, and don&amp;#39;t try to sugarcoat or downplay any issues or concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Follow up on action items: A project status report should not just be a static document &amp;ndash; it should be a starting point for action. Make sure to follow up on any action items or decisions that arise from the report, and keep stakeholders informed about progress on those items.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, delivering effective project status reports requires careful planning and attention to detail. By setting clear expectations, using a consistent format, focusing on key messages, and being transparent and honest, project managers can ensure that their project status reports are effective and useful to stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any project that is in progress, the project manager will create a weekly status report. The status report will have a summary status with one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Red - The project has outstanding issues that require immediate attention from the Project Sponsor.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yellow - The project has outstanding issues that require the project sponsor&amp;#39;s attention.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Green - The project has no outstanding issues that require the project sponsor&amp;#39;s attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Status Report Details&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the high-level status, the project status report will include the following sections:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Accomplishments - Deliverables that were completed and delivered in the past week&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Planned Activities for Next Week - Deliverables that will be completed and delivered in the next week&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Issues Needing Action - Issues needing action by the Project leadership or sponsor&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Issues Resolved - Issues that were resolved in the past week&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Budget - The state of the project budget includes approved scope changes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project burn rate - An accounting of the cost per week of the project team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Schedule - Description of the state of the project schedule. Can also include a copy of the MS Project document, an HTML report from MS Project, or a link to the MS Project document on a server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication&lt;/strong&gt; is a significant portion of a project managers duties. Communications should support the effective creation, transfer, and retention of critical information related to the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Levels of Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-level communications&lt;/strong&gt; - This type of communication allows a breadth of information to be reviewed at a surface level. This communication often is the catalyst for identifying items that need to be tactically discussed. This communication is usually between the project management and the project sponsors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Make sure that the information neeed for critial decisions is presented, but avoid over communicating.&amp;nbsp; This type of communication is often preformed via a presentation at a meeting of an executive team.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tactical communications&lt;/strong&gt; - This type of communication allows a detailed discussion to occur typically about a specified topic. This communication is usually between the project manager and the primary project sponsor. This type of communication can be informal and performed using phone, email, fax, and face-to-face meetings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formal Communications&lt;/strong&gt; - The interaction of personnel through regular briefing sessions is an effective way to ensure constructive knowledge transfer. The goal of this formal communication is to document the state of the project. Formal communication documents should not be used to deliver new information about a project. New information about the project is best delivered via tactical communications between the project manager and the primary project sponsor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Formal Communication by the project manager for the sponsors will include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High-level Project Communication is usually targeted towards the project steering committee in the form of weekly status meetings, reports, and presentations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Identification&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Leadership&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Budget Status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Timeline Status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Critical Project Action Items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detailed Project Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delivered to the team and project sponsor in the form of daily tactical communications.&amp;nbsp; These are then formalized into a weekly status report document for the project archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Budget Status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Timeline Status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Action Items&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The Project Life Cycle" id="dx_temp_1373561917631_663" src="/sites/projectmechanics/img/project-life-cycle.jpg" style="float:right; height:395px; width:401px" title="The Project Mechanics Project Life Cycle or States of a Project" /&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;Project Life Cycle&lt;/strong&gt; is a series of phases that a project goes through from its inception to its completion. Project Mechanics recommend a standard project lifecycle to ensure that projects are consistently defined, planned, and executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Project Life Cycle&lt;/strong&gt; refers to a logical sequence of activities to accomplish the project&amp;rsquo;s goals or objectives. Project activities are grouped into phases so that the project manager and the core team can efficiently plan and organize resources for each activity. &amp;nbsp; By planning activities by stages the project manager can objectively measure achievement of goals and justify their decisions to move ahead, correct, or terminate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All projects go through a life cycle that starts at the initial project inception through project shut down. When applying &lt;strong&gt;Project Mechanics&lt;/strong&gt;, it is critical to accurately assess the stage of the project in the life cycle. It is important to note that not every project will be completed. For example, some projects will not have the proper business justification to make it out of the Project Definition stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the stages of the project life cycle for projects in the professional services arena:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future / Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt; - An opportunity has been identified, however, no team has been assigned to define the opportunity.&amp;nbsp; At this point the project is most likely on some list of potential projects.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Definition&lt;/strong&gt; - The Project Sponsor has agreed to fund the creation of a project definition. A team has been assigned to define the project and create a proposal. An accounting code is created to track all time used to define the project during the solution definition effort. A limited team is a used; the deliverable from this phase is a proposal to do the project. This phase does not include any analysis, design, comps, or documentation other than what is required to propose the work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proposed&lt;/strong&gt; - A proposal has been presented to the Project Sponsor for approval. This proposal should have an expiration date and specific metrics for when the team can start (i.e. 2 weeks from approval). If resources are named, it should be noted that these resources may not be available for this project if the defined time frame is exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approved&lt;/strong&gt; - The Project Sponsor has approved the project proposal. The process of defining the project team and setting the project priority has begun. When a team and priority is defined, the project kickoff is scheduled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Progress&lt;/strong&gt; - A team is working on the project. Weekly status reports are maintained. A formal change control process is being used to document any changes to the project charter (scope, timeline, budget).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete&lt;/strong&gt; - The project has been delivered. There is no one working on the project. The project code has been closed. The final invoice has been sent. The result of the project is in production and under the control of ongoing support.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancelled&lt;/strong&gt; - At any stage in the&amp;nbsp;project life cycle, a project may be placed on hold,&amp;nbsp;rejected or canceled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The project management process&lt;/strong&gt; addresses the entire &lt;strong&gt;project life cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. The project management process enables teams and individuals to successfully deliver solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;project management process&lt;/strong&gt; is designed to produce high quality solutions in the shortest period of time possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>
      <LocationSummary>The project lifecycle is a series of phases that a project goes through from its inception to its completion. Project Management Offices (PMOs) often use a standard project lifecycle to ensure that projects are properly defined, planned, and executed.</LocationSummary>

&lt;p&gt;Project tracking software is a tool that helps project managers and team members to monitor and manage the progress of a project. This type of software typically includes features such as task and milestone tracking, resource management, collaboration tools, and reporting and analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using project tracking software can help project managers to stay organized and on top of the many tasks and details involved in a project. It can also help team members to stay focused and on track, and it can provide stakeholders with real-time visibility into the progress of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some key benefits of using project tracking software include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Improved visibility and transparency: Project tracking software provides a central hub where all project information is stored and organized. This makes it easy for team members and stakeholders to access and view the latest project updates, ensuring that everyone has a clear understanding of the project&amp;#39;s status.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Enhanced collaboration and communication: Many project tracking tools include collaboration and communication features, such as team chat, file sharing, and real-time updates. This can help to improve collaboration and communication among team members, and it can help to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;More efficient task and milestone tracking: Project tracking software makes it easy to track tasks and milestones, and to see at a glance which tasks are on track, behind schedule, or complete. This can help project managers to identify potential bottlenecks or delays, and to take corrective action to keep the project on track.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Better resource management: Project tracking software can help project managers to track and manage the resources required for a project, such as personnel, equipment, and materials. This can help to ensure that the project has the necessary resources to meet its deadlines, and it can help to prevent resource-related delays or bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;More accurate reporting and analytics: Project tracking software often includes reporting and analytics features that make it easy to generate detailed reports and visualizations of the project&amp;#39;s progress. This can help project managers to identify trends and patterns, and to make data-driven decisions that can improve the project&amp;#39;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective use of project tracking software can help project managers and teams to stay organized, on track, and on budget. However, there are a few key best practices that project managers should follow to ensure that they get the most out of their project tracking software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Choose the right tool: Not all project tracking tools are created equal, and it&amp;#39;s important to choose a tool that meets the specific needs of your project. Consider factors such as the size of your team, the complexity of the project, and the type of information that you need to track.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Ensure that all team members are trained and onboarded: For project tracking software to be effective, it&amp;#39;s important that all team members know how to use the tool and are comfortable with its features. Invest in training and onboarding to ensure that everyone is up to speed and can use the tool effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Establish clear project goals and milestones: Before you start using project tracking software, it&amp;#39;s important to establish clear goals and milestones for the project. This will provide a framework for tracking progress, and it will help to ensure that the project stays on track and aligned with its objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Regularly update and maintain the project tracking tool: Project tracking software is only as effective as the information that it contains. Make sure to regularly update the tool with the latest project information, and to keep it organized and accurate. This will help to ensure that the tool provides useful and accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Use the tool to identify trends and patterns: Project tracking software can provide valuable insights and analytics that can help project managers to identify trends and patterns in the project. Use these insights to make data-driven decisions that can improve the project&amp;#39;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting the right&amp;nbsp;project-tracking software requires careful planning, training, and maintenance. By following these best practices, project managers can ensure that they get the most out of their project tracking tool and can keep their projects on track and on budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most popular project-tracking tools are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Project Plans&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Excel Spreadsheets&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Web Applications (SaaS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what method is used, the &lt;strong&gt;project tracking&lt;/strong&gt; system should provide some key functionality that includes: practical estimating and efficient project organizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a foundation for effective project controls, Project Managers should establish formats, repositories, and procedures for the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style-type:circle"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meetings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Issues/Change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Standards&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Invoices&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Staff Development&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project Tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;strong&gt;Do you have valuable content locked in a format that you can't easily access?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Mechanics can provide content migration strategies to help retain your search engine placement, while moving you to a publishing framework that will help your web site respond as your business changes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In the world of distributed publishing, it is hard integrate your content into a unified experience.&amp;nbsp; While the use of community publishing allows you to reach out to your customer base where they are, you still need a platform that reinforces your own brand.&amp;nbsp; Web Project Mechanics facilitates the integration of distributed channels by importing web feeds into your own website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How Content Gets Trapped&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy for your content to get trapped in system you don't own or are not supported anymore.   Whenever you switch from one blogging platform to another, your content gets stranded.  You need tools to help you redirect visitors to the new version of your pages.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;h2&gt;Project Initiation - &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s Get This Party Started&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first steps in the project process is the &lt;strong&gt;project initiation&lt;/strong&gt;. During the &lt;strong&gt;project initiation process&lt;/strong&gt;, validate that the project charter and proposal document&amp;nbsp;clearly define a project that best fits the customer&amp;rsquo;s goals and objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to have an approach for clearly identifying the &lt;em&gt;measurable&amp;nbsp;benefits&lt;/em&gt; that will result from completing the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the sign-off of the Project Proposal, the actual project ramp-up can begin. &amp;nbsp;Here are some suggested activities for the initial steps to be followed on a well-managed project.&amp;nbsp; Client requirements, the specific nature of the project, and other project variables will almost always necessitate project specific implementation variations, but the tasks as outlined should form the basis for the eventual implementation approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Request Job Number Setup from Accounting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ensure timely project invoicing, it is critical that a job number be assigned as early as possible.&amp;nbsp; Fill out the Job Number Request Form and send it to Accounting.&amp;nbsp; Accounting will provide you with the new job number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Start Project Management File&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file should include the Job Arrangement Letter, the Professional Service Agreement, and any Requests for Proposal from the client, any relevant correspondences, and important background material.&amp;nbsp; The file will serve as a repository for all ongoing materials relating to the project including Status Reports, Meeting Minutes, Invoices, etc&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; The Project Manager for every job should create a project file.&amp;nbsp; The Project Manager is also responsible for forwarding copies of all Invoices, project proposals, and PSAs to the Company Chief Financial Officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Review Project Checklist&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tools &amp;amp; Templates II provides a generic project checklist that should serve as a guide for the Project Initiation stage.&amp;nbsp; The list is divided into several sections including Work Area, Telephones, Network, and Office Supplies.&amp;nbsp; Certain aspects of this checklist may not be relevant to a specific project, and each project will likely bring additional items to be addressed, such as travel policy creation.&amp;nbsp; The list simply serves as a guide in the project initiation process, and should serve as a basis for a project specific checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Create Orientation Binder&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For larger, multi-phase projects, an orientation binder is often warranted.&amp;nbsp; This binder includes any material required to bring new team members &amp;ldquo;up to speed&amp;rdquo; on the project and outlines the specific procedures and guidelines of the project.&amp;nbsp; Tools &amp;amp; Templates II provides a generic outline of items that may be included in a new Project Orientation Binder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Review/Confirm Project Vision&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure you have a clear vision of what you are trying to accomplish.&amp;nbsp; Without a clearly articulated vision, team members will be confused as to what you want them to do (&lt;em&gt;Read:&lt;/em&gt; Role to choose/accept).&amp;nbsp; It is not possible to delegate and empower a team to achieve an ill-defined goal.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, the first step must be to review the vision formulated in the opportunity assessment effort and verify that this vision is still valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Identify Skills Required&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the project vision has been established, create a list of roles that must be filled.&amp;nbsp; Review the project&amp;rsquo;s work breakdown structure and assess the skills required to create the project deliverables.&amp;nbsp; Do not confuse internal management roles/titles with project delivery skills.&amp;nbsp; For example, your best facilitator may have the worst technical skills.&amp;nbsp; If you need to facilitate technical requirements gathering, define a need for a technical architecture role and a facilitator role.&amp;nbsp; When contacting the staffing group, try to cross-reference the available staff with the required roles.&amp;nbsp; You may find that some roles require two people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obtaining the correct staff with the appropriate skills will reduce project anxiety.&amp;nbsp; It is important to &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;be afraid to augment staff with another team member possessing a specialized skill (facilitation) for an interim period of time.&amp;nbsp; The use of specialized staff will not only reduce project anxiety, but also serve to provide a learning experience for the staff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recognize Incentives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project managers should try to identify the possible &amp;ldquo;wins&amp;rdquo; for each team member.&amp;nbsp; If team members are given proper incentive, and they are aware of their personal wins, it will be possible to achieve accelerated change.&amp;nbsp; It is important to get incentives aligned between clients, consultants, and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Allocate Resources&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resources are defined as all personnel and things required to achieve the stated project goal.&amp;nbsp; Failure to secure appropriate resources leads to high frustration levels.&amp;nbsp; Providing adequate workspace, equipment, and appropriately skilled staff is critical to project success.&amp;nbsp; Managers should identify any resource shortfalls and create a plan for filling the gaps.&amp;nbsp; In addition, be sure to communicate this plan to all affected/associated parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Establish Action Plans&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Develop a clear plan for action&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; This plan must ensure appropriate timing of resource acquisition in conjunction with the project goals.&amp;nbsp; A well-defined action plan is essential to communicating the project&amp;rsquo;s vision to the team members.&amp;nbsp; The failure to develop an action plan will result in multiple false starts and a loss of efficiency as dependant tasks may wait on preceding task completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Maintain Lines of Communication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A critical requirement for obtaining team member buy-in in alignment with client expectations is the clear and concise communication of the project&amp;rsquo;s vision, team member&amp;rsquo;s expectations, available resources, and the action plan.&amp;nbsp; The failure to communicate over the course of a project leads to a damaging divergence of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Select a Project &amp;ldquo;Coach&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all projects at Company, a &amp;ldquo;Coach&amp;rdquo; should be identified that will serve as an outside resource providing guidance and direction as required by the Project Manager.&amp;nbsp; On smaller projects, this relationship will likely be very informal, and the Company Business Unit Leader (BUL) will likely fill the &amp;quot;Coach&amp;quot; role.&amp;nbsp; As Company grows and project sizes increase, this role will become more formal and experienced resources other than the BUL will likely be called upon.&amp;nbsp; It is ultimately, however, the responsibility of the Project Manager to identify the Coach for the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coach is intended to be a Company resource that can offer time as required by the Project Manager to discuss issues and aid in keeping the project on track.&amp;nbsp; The client should be aware of the Coach&amp;rsquo;s role, and understand that the Coach is part of Company&amp;rsquo;s process for ensuring project success.&amp;nbsp; Company does not bill for any time the Coach commits to the project, and Coaches will continue to place their highest priority on their own current project or organizational duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Project Kick-Off Meeting&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an initial project team has been constructed, the Project Manager should hold a project kick-off meeting to discuss the future that lies before the project team and outline critical drivers, objectives, etc&amp;hellip; that will be significant to all team members involved.&amp;nbsp; Below is a list of areas that should be addressed in this kick-off meeting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul style="list-style-type:circle"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Expectations of customer/user/sponsors &amp;ndash; Deliverables &amp;amp; &amp;quot;The Journey&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Expectations of team members&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Expectations of Project Manager&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Resources available&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project mechanics (e.g. control procedures, schedules, milestones, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much like the other initiation tasks in this section, the formality of this meeting will greatly depend on the size and scope of the project.&amp;nbsp; In any case, it is a critical step in building the team, and empowering the team members.&amp;nbsp; By drawing the team into the &amp;ldquo;big picture&amp;rdquo; from the beginning, the Project Manager will increase buy-in and build the appropriate mechanisms for communication within the project team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new team members are brought into the project, an informal meeting should be held for the new member in order to minimize the ramp-up time of the team member.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;The management and sponsors of the Program Management Office (PMO) define the scope of the PMO. The PMO defined in this document refers to an organization that manages the delivery of projects defined by a Client Engagement Team (CET). It is these projects that need to be managed in a coordinated way, through a PMO process. However, project management is only one component within the PMO process because projects are managed in an environment that is broader than the projects themselves. Therefore, a PMO process should address multiple areas that each contributes to a coordinated and consolidated effort to achieve the client&amp;#39;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PMO Mission Statement&lt;/strong&gt; The PMO will be the centralized operations unit for all projects for a given client. The PMO will partner with the client and work together with one methodology and process. The PMO is accountable for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Project management,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Communication,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Risk management,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Issue resolution,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Contract administration,&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Client satisfaction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project management office (PMO) mission statement is a statement that defines the purpose, goals, and values of the PMO. It should be clear, concise, and aligned with the overall goals and objectives of the organization. Here are some steps to follow when creating a PMO mission statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define the purpose of the PMO:&amp;nbsp; This should include supporting the organization&amp;#39;s strategic goals, improving project management processes, or providing guidance and support to project managers.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identify the PMO&amp;#39;s goals and objectives: This should include improving project success rates, reducing project costs, or increasing project delivery speed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define the PMO&amp;#39;s values: This should include values such as collaboration, innovation, or customer focus.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Write the mission statement: Once you have defined the purpose, goals, and values of the PMO, write the mission statement. Keep it concise and to the point, and make sure that it clearly and accurately reflects the purpose, goals, and values of the PMO.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Review and refine the mission statement: It is important to review and refine it to ensure that it accurately reflects the PMO&amp;#39;s purpose, goals, and values. This could involve soliciting feedback from stakeholders and making revisions based on that feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PMO should be evaluated on a regular basis. The PMO needs to be reviewed by the executive sponsors. A PMO Evaluation Meeting should occur on a quarterly basis, and should explore, but not be limited to, the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;PMO Overview
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Deliverables&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Budget&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Scheduling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Team Member Performance
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Evaluate work assignments and results&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Identify future assignments, roles, and responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Process and Methodology Use

      <LocationBody>&lt;h3&gt;Project Analysis - What needs to be done, and how will I know when it is done?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis phase is an important part of the project management process in the field of information technology (IT). This phase involves the careful examination and evaluation of the project, its goals, and its requirements, in order to develop a detailed plan for its successful completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt; is a discovery process where you continuously collect and digest information with the purpose of achieving a true understanding of the requirements. Analysis activities are focused on rapid requirement validation and on generating functional specifications. The key outputs of the analysis is answers to the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; needs to be done?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt; does it need to be done?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the &lt;strong&gt;expected benefit&lt;/strong&gt; when it is done?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How do we know we have done it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sources for the analysis can be a written requirements statement, a formal vision document, and interviews with stakeholders or other interested parties. The output of the analysis depends a great deal on the type of project that is being undertaken. Analysis activities include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Following up on information requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Conducting clarification meetings and reviews&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Facilitating&amp;nbsp;functional specification sessions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Creating functional specifications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Developing a business case for project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the analysis phase, IT project managers and their teams typically conduct a number of activities, including the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Defining the project scope: This involves clearly stating the goals and objectives of the project, as well as identifying the specific tasks and activities that need to be completed in order to achieve those goals. This helps to ensure that the project stays on track and focused on its key objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identifying the project stakeholders: Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the project, and who may be impacted by its outcome. Identifying stakeholders helps project managers to understand the different perspectives and needs of the people involved in the project, and to ensure that their concerns are taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Conducting a needs analysis: This involves identifying the specific needs and requirements of the project, such as the technology and resources that will be needed, the skills and expertise of the project team, and any external factors that may impact the project. This helps project managers to develop a realistic plan for completing the project.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Developing a project schedule: A project schedule is a detailed plan that outlines the tasks and activities that need to be completed in order to achieve the project&amp;#39;s goals. This typically includes the timeline for each task, the resources that will be needed, and the dependencies between different tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the analysis phase of successful IT project management is a crucial step in the project management process. By carefully examining and evaluating the project, its goals, and its requirements, IT project managers can develop a detailed and realistic plan for its successful completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;h3&gt;Project Planning - What is it? When are we going to do it ? Who is going to do it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the early steps in the project management process is to create a plan of attack for accomplishing the objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the &lt;strong&gt;project planning process&lt;/strong&gt; is to create a project plan for the project manager and individuals on the team to use and track the progress of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project planning is a critical part of project management, as it helps to ensure that the project is well-defined, well-structured, and feasible. One key aspect of project planning is determining when and how the project will be completed, and who will be involved in the project. Here are some best practices for planning when and with whom to complete a project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identify the project timeline: The first step in project planning is to identify the overall timeline for the project. This should include the project&amp;#39;s start and end dates, as well as any key milestones or deliverables that need to be completed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Break the project into smaller tasks: Once the overall timeline has been established, the next step is to break the project down into smaller, more manageable tasks. This will make it easier to assign tasks to team members, and it will help to ensure that the project stays on track.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Assign tasks to team members: Once the tasks have been identified, the next step is to assign them to team members. Consider each team member&amp;#39;s skills, experience, and availability when making assignments, and make sure that everyone has a clear understanding of their responsibilities and deadlines.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identify dependencies and constraints: It&amp;#39;s important to identify any dependencies and constraints that could affect the project&amp;#39;s timeline or team members&amp;#39; ability to complete their tasks. This could include external factors such as availability of resources or approvals from stakeholders, or internal factors such as team members&amp;#39; schedules or workloads.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Monitor and adjust the plan as needed: Project planning is not a one-time activity &amp;ndash; it&amp;#39;s an ongoing process. Monitor the project&amp;#39;s progress regularly, and adjust the plan as needed to account for changes in the project&amp;#39;s scope, timeline, or team.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective project planning involves determining the project&amp;#39;s timeline, breaking the project down into smaller tasks, assigning those tasks to team members, identifying dependencies and constraints, and monitoring and adjusting the plan as needed. By following these best practices, project managers can ensure that the project is completed on time and with the right team in place.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;h3&gt;Project Development - Doing the Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;strong&gt;development process,&lt;/strong&gt; the desired functionality is developed and a compelling proposition for each customer, consumer, and project constituent is produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once a project has been planned and the team has been assembled, the next step is to actually do the work. This is often the most challenging part of project management, as it involves coordinating the efforts of multiple team members, managing resources, and dealing with any issues or challenges that arise. Here are some best practices for doing the work in a project management context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Communicate regularly: Effective communication is essential for the success of a project. Make sure to communicate regularly with team members and stakeholders, and provide clear and concise updates on the project&amp;#39;s progress. This will help to keep everyone informed and on the same page, and it will help to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Monitor and track progress: It&amp;#39;s important to monitor and track the project&amp;#39;s progress regularly, and to make sure that the project is staying on track. This could involve using project tracking software, conducting regular status meetings, or using other tools and techniques to track the project&amp;#39;s progress.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Manage risks and issues: No project is without risks and issues, and it&amp;#39;s important to manage them effectively to keep the project on track. Identify potential risks and issues early, and develop contingency plans to address them. This will help to prevent small issues from becoming major problems.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Manage resources: Effective resource management is critical for the success of a project. Make sure that the project has the necessary personnel, equipment, and materials to meet its deadlines, and monitor and manage those resources carefully to prevent any shortages or bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Adapt to change: Projects are often dynamic and subject to change, and it&amp;#39;s important to be flexible and adaptable in your approach to project management. Be prepared to adjust the project plan as needed to account for changes in the project&amp;#39;s scope, timeline, or team.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing the work in a project management context involves effective communication, progress monitoring, risk and issue management, resource management, and adaptability to change. By following these best practices, project managers can ensure that the project is completed successfully and on time.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;h3&gt;Design Project Solution - Specifically how are we going to do this?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;strong&gt;design process&lt;/strong&gt;, the design team translates the requirements and specifications into the solution definition and designs the necessary components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the project solution is an important part of project management, as it involves identifying and defining the specific steps and actions that will be taken to achieve the project&amp;#39;s objectives. Here are some best practices for designing the project solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define the problem or opportunity: Before you can design a solution, it&amp;#39;s important to clearly define the problem or opportunity that the project is addressing. This will help to ensure that the solution is focused and aligned with the project&amp;#39;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identify the stakeholders: Stakeholders are individuals or groups who have a vested interest in the project, and it&amp;#39;s important to identify them early in the process. This will help to ensure that the solution takes their needs and preferences into account, and it will help to build support for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Develop alternative solutions: Once the problem or opportunity has been defined, the next step is to develop alternative solutions. This could involve brainstorming sessions, research, or other techniques to generate ideas. Make sure to consider a range of possible solutions, and to evaluate each one based on its feasibility, cost, and potential impact.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Select the best solution: Once you have developed a range of alternative solutions, it&amp;#39;s time to select the best one. This should be based on a thorough evaluation of the pros and cons of each solution, and it should take into account the project&amp;#39;s goals, constraints, and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define the solution in detail: Once the best solution has been selected, the next step is to define it in detail. This should include a clear description of the steps and actions that will be taken to implement the solution, as well as any resources, budgets, or timelines that are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Communicate the solution to stakeholders: The final step in designing the project solution is to communicate it to stakeholders. This should include a clear and concise explanation of the solution, and it should address any questions or concerns that stakeholders may have.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Designing the project solution involves defining the problem or opportunity, identifying stakeholders, developing alternative solutions, selecting the best solution, defining it in detail, and communicating it to stakeholders. By following these best practices, project managers can ensure that the project solution is well-defined and aligned with the project&amp;#39;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;h3&gt;Project Testing - Did I do what I set out to do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective project management planning involves setting clear, measurable, and achievable objectives that can be tracked and monitored over the course of the project. By setting these objectives, project managers can ensure that the project stays on track, that the project&amp;#39;s goals are being met, and that any issues or challenges are identified and addressed in a timely manner. Here are some best practices for setting measurable objective goals in project management planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identify the project&amp;#39;s key objectives: These should be aligned with the project&amp;#39;s overall goals and objectives, and they should be specific, measurable, and achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define specific and measurable goals: These should be quantifiable so that they can be tracked and monitored over the course of the project. For example, instead of setting a goal to &amp;quot;improve customer satisfaction,&amp;quot; set a goal to &amp;quot;increase customer satisfaction by 10%.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Set realistic and achievable goals: It&amp;#39;s important to set goals that are realistic and achievable, given the project&amp;#39;s constraints and resources. Avoid setting overly ambitious goals that are unlikely to be met, as this can lead to disappointment and frustration. Instead, set goals that are challenging but achievable, and that will provide a sense of accomplishment and progress.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Create a plan for tracking and monitoring progress: Once the goals have been set, the next step is to create a plan for tracking and monitoring progress. This could involve using project management software, conducting regular status meetings, or using other tools and techniques to track and monitor the project&amp;#39;s progress.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Regularly review and adjust the plan: Project management planning is not a one-time activity &amp;ndash; it&amp;#39;s an ongoing process. Regularly review and adjust the plan to account for changes in the project&amp;#39;s scope, timeline, or team, and make sure that the goals remain relevant and achievable.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the &lt;strong&gt;testing process&lt;/strong&gt;, manage testing as a continuous activity and generate trusted results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing is an activity necessary in all phases of a project. Responsibility for testing at different points in the project should be clearly assigned with adequate resources committed to the testing effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing projects can be a daunting task. With so many moving parts, it can be difficult to keep track of all the tasks that need to be completed. A project checklist can help you stay organized and ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner. Here are some tips for creating a project checklist that will help you manage your projects more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify the Project Goals: Before you can create a project checklist, you need to identify the goals of the project. What is the purpose of the project? What are the desired outcomes? Having a clear understanding of the project goals will help you create a checklist that is tailored to the specific needs of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Break Down the Tasks: Once you have identified the project goals, you can begin to break down the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve those goals. Make sure to include all the necessary steps, from start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prioritize the Tasks: Once you have identified all the tasks that need to be completed, you can begin to prioritize them. Which tasks are most important? Which tasks can be completed later? Prioritizing the tasks will help you stay focused and ensure that the most important tasks are completed first.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assign Deadlines: Once you have identified and prioritized the tasks, you can begin to assign deadlines for each task. Make sure to give yourself enough time to complete each task, but don&amp;rsquo;t be too generous with the deadlines. Having deadlines will help you stay on track and ensure that the project is completed on time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Track Progress: As you work through the project, track your progress. This will help you stay organized and ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a project checklist is an important part of managing projects. By following these tips, you can create a checklist that will help you stay organized and ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When assigned a project, it is very important to quickly determine the current state of the project.&amp;nbsp; Projects rarely start when you do. Usually, there is a project life before you started that is critical to gaining a thorough understanding of the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a project is assigned to you do not assume that all previous steps have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;strong&gt;project checklists&lt;/strong&gt; can serve as a guide to discovering what has been done, and more importantly, what has not been done on a project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="rightnav"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Checklists&lt;/strong&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="/project-initiation-checklist" target="pdf"&gt;Project Initiation Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Every project should have a place (physical binder,&amp;nbsp;web site, word document, whatever)&amp;nbsp;which contains all the information&amp;nbsp;about the project. Not every item on this list is relevant for every project, but you as a project manager must make a conscious decision NOT to include it, just the process of evaluating the list can raise some issues about the project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While the primary purpose of this is to give new resouces and orientation to the project, it also serves as a valuable checklist for the project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;h2&gt;Change is inevitable.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change management is an important aspect of project management, as it helps to ensure that changes to the project are properly planned and implemented. Here are some best practices for successful project managers in change management:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Communicate clearly: It is important to clearly communicate the reason for the change and how it will impact the project. This should be done in a timely manner to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the change.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Involve all stakeholders: It is important to involve all stakeholders in the change management process, including team members, customers, and other parties who will be affected by the change. This can help to ensure that the change is well-received and that potential issues are identified and addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Develop a plan: A change management plan should be developed to outline the steps that will be taken to implement the change and any potential impacts or risks.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Monitor progress: It is important to monitor the progress of the change and make any necessary adjustments to ensure that it is implemented successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Evaluate the change: Upon completion of the change, it is important to evaluate its impact and assess whether it has achieved the desired results. This can help to identify any areas for improvement and inform future change management efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these best practices, project managers can effectively manage changes to the project and ensure that they are implemented smoothly and successfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project management process is creative, and will naturally bring about some change and the need for &lt;strong&gt;change management&lt;/strong&gt;. The project manager&amp;#39;s job is to recognize the inherent discovery process in the project and manage the change - not stop it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set a tolerance level.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to formally manage small changes can overwhelm the project manager and distract user management. Informal &lt;strong&gt;change control&lt;/strong&gt; can be used when the project budget and schedule are not affected. All changes are documented for reference purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Manage expectations as well as scope.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assess and manage change requires the project manager to be sensitive to the people dimension of the project. Managing the perceptions of team members and the user community is just as important as managing scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Purpose of Change Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of change management is to ensure that the scope of work does not increase without appropriate approval. The change control process should provide a way for the Project Sponsor to approve all modifications to the budget, scope, or schedule of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Change Management Process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Change management involves the documentation, tracking systems and approval levels necessary to justify and manage changes to the budget, scope, and schedule for a project. The scope detailed in the project proposal is the baseline against which changes will be controlled. A change control system is put in place to preserve the integrity of the project charter and to allow for the management of change requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note, that the success of change management depends on a detailed project baseline (Statement of Work). There is a natural discovery process in all projects due to factors such as omissions, mistakes, creativity, misunderstandings, and external influences. This discovery process normally creates pressure to modify the project scope, schedule, or budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the change management process is to constructively manage that pressure. A change to the project scope is acceptable as long as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The project sponsors agree that change is justified&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The impact of the change on the project is analyzed and understood&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Resulting change to the project (i.e. cost, timing, quality, and human resources) are approved and properly implemented.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The project plan is updated and republished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change management process provides a means for retaining historical change information that can be used to enhance future project efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Project Change Life Cycle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Initiation of the Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone within the project organization can request a change by completing a change request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Impact Assessment of the Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project manager will review the change request; the impact of the change will be assessed across all knowledge areas. The project manager will document the impact of the change on the current scope, schedule, and project budget. The completed change document is submitted to the project steering committee that is identified during the project initiation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Approval of the Change&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appropriate project sponsor will ultimately approve or reject the change request. Upon approval of the request, the client project sponsor, and the project manager will sign the change request form. The project manager will maintain a hard copy of the signed change request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Rejected Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Project Sponsor may close the change request at any point in the process prior to approval. If the change request is rejected, the change request is still maintained. However, the scope, schedule, and budget are not affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Implementation of the Change&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project manager will incorporate the change into the overall project scope and republish the project schedule, budget, and scope definition documents as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project meetings&lt;/strong&gt; can be the black hole of project management. Without some basic &lt;strong&gt;meeting guidelines&lt;/strong&gt;, the project can grind to a halt as meeting after meeting takes over everyone&amp;#39;s time. It does not have to be that way. Meetings can be a place where great progress is made and an effective use of team member&amp;rsquo;s time. But you must make sure that you have the right people at the right meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too many times team members suffer from FoMS (Fear of Missing Something) and attend meetings outside of their role on the project. A way to combat FoMS is to make your project meeting schedule public and to make access to meeting minutes easy. Offering a way for project team members to view and comment on meetings they did not attend will also help combat FoMS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All project meetings&amp;nbsp;should be scheduled in advance and have a published agenda and attendance guidelines.Even in the event of an emergency meeting, a quick agenda (for example: Why is the server down?) and documented meeting results are critical. Action items from a meeting should be tracked through an issue management system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting minutes&lt;/strong&gt; should be published and readily available to all team members as quickly as possible. The&amp;nbsp;purpose of the meeting minutes is to create a history of the decisions made in meetings and to give project team members the&amp;nbsp;information they need to&amp;nbsp;decide which meetings to attend in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting minutes&lt;/strong&gt; should contain the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The person who called the meeting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The time the meeting occurred&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The formal name of the project that the meeting is associated with&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Brief description of the meeting purpose&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;List of all meeting attendees&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The meeting agenda&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meeting Minutes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting minutes are a summation of the discussions, action items and decisions from the meeting. It is very important to clearly specify any decisions that were made at the meeting. Action items should be cross-referenced with&amp;nbsp;a issue management system.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;A highly structured meeting in which the meeting leader (the 
facilitator) guides the participants through a series of pre-defined steps to 
arrive at a result that is created, understood and accepted by all 
participants.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Guidelines&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The following guidelines will help to ensure that our sessions run smoothly 
and that we achieve our objectives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Rank 
&lt;DD&gt;Leave rank/position in the company at the door. When we convene for these 
meetings, our objective is to provide as creative an atmosphere as possible. 
Pulling rank can stifle creativity. When must all actively promote ourselves as 
equals in the workshop sessions. 
&lt;DT&gt;Judgment 
&lt;DT&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Participants need to suspend judgment while generating ideas and discussing 
issues. We should only judge under limited circumstances. For example, we need 
our judgment to prioritize or vote on issues. However, the key is to listen and 
learn from other participants. Try to avoid using "killer phrases" such as, 
"That will never work," or "That is a terrible idea." Finally, recognize that 
not everyone in the room may share your opinion and we must respect the opinion 
of others. 
&lt;DT&gt;Attendance 
&lt;DT&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Participants should place a high priority on both large group and break our 
group meetings. Interruptions to meetings fall under the "100 Mile Rule." This 
rule states, "No one should be called from the meeting unless it is so important 
that the disruption would occur even if the meeting was 100 miles away from the 
work place 
&lt;DT&gt;Promptness 
&lt;DT&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;All meetings should start and end on time. This adherence to schedule makes 
it easier to stay on target with the agenda. 
&lt;DT&gt;Participation 
&lt;DT&gt;
&lt;DD&gt;Everyone's viewpoint is valuable. Every participant can make a unique 
contribution to the project. Therefore, we must emphasize the importance of both 
speaking freely and listening attentively. If unequal participation is a 
problem, we must structure discussions so that everyone can contribute. Keep 
your comments short so that all participants have the opportunity to 
participate. Dominating the discussions will not only limit others' 
participation, but may also intimidate some of the group members. &lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;H1&gt;Basic Conversational Courtesies&lt;/H1&gt;Listen attentively and respectfully to 
others; do not interrupt; one conversation at a time; and so forth. 
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Breaks 
&lt;DD&gt;We will take scheduled breaks periodically throughout the morning and 
afternoon sessions. We will limit these breaks to 15 minutes. All participants 
must return from breaks on time to enable the group to meet the workshop 
objectives. 
&lt;DT&gt;Consensus 
&lt;DD&gt;Participants will be asked to reach decisions by consensus. Consensus is 
more efficient and allows greater buy-in to decisions than voting or unanimous 
agreement. &lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;What is the role of the facilitator?&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Guide 
&lt;DD&gt;The facilitator must know the steps of the process from beginning to end, 
and he must carefully guide the participants through each phase. 
&lt;DT&gt;Motivator 
&lt;DD&gt;From the rousing opening statement, to the closing words of cheer, the 
facilitator must ignite a fire within the group and keep it well lit. The 
facilitator must establish momentum and keep pace. 
&lt;DT&gt;Bridge Builder 
&lt;DD&gt;Where other people see differences, the facilitator must see similarities 
and use the similarities to establish a foundation for building bridges to 
consensus. 
&lt;DT&gt;Clairvoyant 
&lt;DD&gt;Throughout the session, the facilitator must watch carefully for potential 
signs of strain, weariness, aggravation, dis-empowerment and respond in advance 
to avoid dysfunctional behavior. 
&lt;DT&gt;Peacemaker 
&lt;DD&gt;While it is almost always better to avoid a direct confrontation between 
participants, should such an event occur the facilitator must quickly step in, 
re-establish order and direct the energy toward constructive resolution. 
&lt;DT&gt;Taskmaster 
&lt;DD&gt;The facilitator is ultimately responsible for keeping the session on track; 
this means tactfully cutting short irrelevant discussions, preventing detours 
off the main course and maintaining a consistent level of detail throughout. 
&lt;DT&gt;Praiser 
&lt;DD&gt;At every opportunity to do so, the facilitator should praise the effort put 
forth, the progress made, and the results achieved. Praise well, praise often, 
praise specifically. &lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;What are the other roles in a facilitated session?&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Project Sponsor 
&lt;DD&gt;Sets the overall objectives for the session. Typically kicks off the 
facilitated session to demonstrate support for the activity. 
&lt;DT&gt;Project Manager 
&lt;DD&gt;Oversees the content of the facilitated session to ensure that the project 
objectives are being met. 
&lt;DT&gt;Documentor 
&lt;DD&gt;Documents the results of the session as recorded by the facilitator, being 
sure to avoid any paraphrasing or alteration. 
&lt;DT&gt;Timekeeper 
&lt;DD&gt;Tracks the time of each activity in the session, and alerts the group when 
an activity exceeds the time allotted. 
&lt;DT&gt;Participant 
&lt;DD&gt;Participates in the facilitated session by contributing to the discussion 
and ensuring that the content is accurate, acceptable and sufficiently 
comprehensive; should arrive at the session prepared to participate. 
&lt;DT&gt;Observer 
&lt;DD&gt;Quietly observes the session activity without impacting the result. 
&lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the session objective:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Why are we having this session? 
&lt;LI&gt;What is the purpose? 
&lt;LI&gt;What are the expected results from the session? 
&lt;LI&gt;What is it that made you ecstatic? 
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Pretend for a minute that we were at the end of the session and 
about to wrap up,and you were ecstatic because as a result of the session we... 
Fill in the blank.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Your room and other aids:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Use a "horse shoe" or "open U" or semi circle seating arrangement. 
&lt;LI&gt;Post ground rules, parking boards and session objective and agenda at the 
front. 
&lt;LI&gt;Ensure adequate supplies are available (flip chart, multi-colored markers, 
tape, name tags, coffee, cups, water). &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Your opening words must:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Inform the participants about what is going to happen through the session 
objective. 
&lt;LI&gt;Get them excited about the process by giving them a clear vision of the 
overall result to be achieved and the benefits. 
&lt;LI&gt;Get them involved in the process by having them speak as early as possible 
(e.g. asking their personal objectives). 
&lt;LI&gt;Empower them by discussing the important role they play in the process, the 
reason they were selected, the authority that has been given to them, etc. 
&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Getting Started:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Arrive early 
&lt;LI&gt;Set up 
&lt;LI&gt;Interact with Participants during the gathering period 
&lt;LI&gt;Kick-off promptly 
&lt;LI&gt;Give opening statement 
&lt;LI&gt;Review purpose, agenda, ground rules, parking boards, and housekeeping 
&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Sample Ground Rules:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Everyone speaks 
&lt;LI&gt;Respect the speaker 
&lt;LI&gt;Everyone in equal 
&lt;LI&gt;No idea is dumb 
&lt;LI&gt;Avoid &amp;#8220;sidebar discussion&amp;#8221; 
&lt;LI&gt;Start on time/end on time 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;#8220;Choo, Choo&amp;#8221; 
&lt;LI&gt;(think outside the nine dots) &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Parking Boards:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;Help you keep the group focused by having a place to &amp;#8220;park&amp;#8221; 
discussion topics that don&amp;#8217;t need to be addressed at the moment they come up. By 
&amp;#8220;parking&amp;#8221; a topic, you are telling the participant that the input was valuable 
and will be addressed at a later date.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Issues List 
&lt;DD&gt;items relevant to the session that need to be discussed later in the session 
or outside the session. 
&lt;DT&gt;Decisions List 
&lt;DD&gt;decisions that are made by the group that should be documented for future

&lt;DT&gt;Actions List 
&lt;DD&gt;actions to be performed sometime after completion of the session. &lt;/DD&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Warm up the Group:&lt;/H2&gt;It is typical for participants in a session to be 
initially reserved and very willing to allow others to speak first. Therefore, 
it is not unusual for the first question the facilitator asks to be met with 
complete silence. To ensure that you avoid this question/silence pitfall, it is 
important to warm-up the group. Get them used to responding, first non-verbally, 
then verbally: 
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Ask a series of pre-questions (at least two) which lead up to your primary 
question 
&lt;LI&gt;Structure each pre-question so that the response requires some level of 
non-verbal participant involvement (e.g. raised hand) 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;#8220;How many of you have ever participated in a facilitated session?&amp;#8221; 
&lt;LI&gt;&amp;#8220;How many of you have ever participated in a requirements definition 
project?&amp;#8221; &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Focusing the Group:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Label your charts 
&lt;LI&gt;Avoid detours by using 
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Objective 
&lt;LI&gt;Ground rules 
&lt;LI&gt;Parking Boards 
&lt;LI&gt;Redirecting questions 
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;(&amp;#8220;What you are saying is interesting,should we put it on the issues 
list...&amp;#8221; and then focus back)&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Be conscious of time constraints&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;The Seven Deadly Sins of Facilitation:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;More times than not, these sins by the facilitator will lead to some 
form of dysfunctional behavior by one or more members o the group. If the 
facilitator continues his/her behavior, full scale revolt by the participants is 
quite possible.&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The facilitator chooses which comments are worthy to be recorded on the flip 
charts. 
&lt;LI&gt;The facilitator interprets the words that are spoken and records the 
interpretation, instead of recording what is said. 
&lt;LI&gt;The facilitator permits the group to wander away from the stated objective 
for extended periods of time. 
&lt;LI&gt;The facilitator permits the ground rules to be broken without taking 
visible, corrective action. 
&lt;LI&gt;The facilitator is perceived as losing neutrality and favoring one position 
over another. 
&lt;LI&gt;The facilitator speaks emotionally charged words at a session attendee or 
permits a session attendee to speak emotionally charged words to another, and 
does not take visible, corrective action. 
&lt;LI&gt;The facilitator allows an atmosphere of distrust or disrespect to build 
between himself/herself and the session attendees.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;The Power of the Pen:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Write first, discuss second. 
&lt;LI&gt;Write what is said, not what your heard. 
&lt;LI&gt;Write so they can read it. 
&lt;LI&gt;Edit by adding, use a different colored pen. 
&lt;LI&gt;Slow down a speaker who is talking too fast by speaking as you write. 
&lt;LI&gt;If more than one person tries to speak, order the speakers.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Information Gathering:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;DL&gt;
&lt;DT&gt;Listing: 
&lt;DD&gt;to gather detail 
&lt;DT&gt;Brain-storming 
&lt;DD&gt;to generate ideas 
&lt;DT&gt;Grouping 
&lt;DD&gt;to categorize 
&lt;DT&gt;Prioritize 
&lt;DD&gt;to identify the most important items 
&lt;DT&gt;Questions: &lt;/DT&gt;&lt;/DL&gt;
&lt;TABLE border=1&gt;
&lt;THEAD&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TH&gt;Type&lt;/TH&gt;
&lt;TH&gt;Purpose&lt;/TH&gt;
&lt;TH&gt;Example&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/THEAD&gt;
&lt;TBODY&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Direct Probe&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Challenge or probe&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Why is that important?&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Indirect Probe&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Probe/clarify&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Is the reason that&amp;#8217;s important because...?&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Redirection&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Get back on track&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a good point. Can we put that on the issues list?&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Playback&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Confirm&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;It sounds like what you are saying&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Leading Question&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Lead to other thoughts&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Are there solutions in the area of...?&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Prompt Question&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Keep the ideas flowing&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;What else...&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Tag Question&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Get acknowledgment&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;That&amp;#8217;s important, isn&amp;#8217;t it?&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Float an Idea&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;Give a possible solution&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;What about...? What are the&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
&lt;TR&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
&lt;TD&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;
&lt;H2&gt;Closing the Session:&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Review activities performed during the session. 
&lt;LI&gt;Review all parking boards, decisions made and issues outstanding 
&lt;LI&gt;Identify a spokesperson 
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Close the session by thanking the participants and reviewing next

      <LocationBody>&lt;h2&gt;How To Organize A Seminar Or An Event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Matt Bacak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seminars and events have always been implemented as a holistic experience to participants. Thus, organizing an event requires extensive planning and preparation with most work implemented at least a few months before the actual event. Most of the time, seminars seem to run like clockwork with all events flowing smoothly according to schedule. In reality however, much groundwork has been worked on with the purpose of developing the right atmosphere in addition to a beneficial experience to participants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Establishing the theme of the event&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each event follows a theme and purpose which will drive the event set-up, the target audiences or the participants, the guests and the marketing approach. In general, a business event such as an international conference for a particular industry will appeal to participants conducting businesses within that industry as well as sponsors who gain mileage out of publicizing their products during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, the theme of the seminar will also determine the type of marketing channels to be used to for publicity. This also holds true for the seminar marketing team who will need the event theme to correctly identify target participants and companies to sell the event to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Selecting a venue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue selection is highly dependent on the scale of the event. Usually this is determined by the number of participants, the presence of any guests of honor (such as royalty or politicians) the activities during the event, or if there are additional floor space required for exhibition purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical seminar of about 100 - 200 can be comfortably implemented in a hotel seminar room, possibly in a theater style setting or classroom setting. However, larger scale events with participant numbers scaling between 500 - 1000 may require a large hall, ballroom, auditorium or a convention center.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The location and quality standard of the venue is also important especially if the event involves the participation of VIPs. With this, a reputable location would be imperative, including good quality and wide range of seminar facilities available. It is always wise to explore the possibility of a few venues and examine their location suitability, level of services, ambiance, and costs before coming to a decision.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Seminar Marketing and Publicity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Seminar marketing is by far the most critical and often most challenging task in event organizing, and is often regarded as the most critical factor of an event's success. This is because the number of participants turning up for a seminar is highly dependent on the strength of marketing activities and publicity. Whether or not the event achieves its objective or whether the organizers will walk home with a profit or loss largely depends on the marketability of the event. This means that the right marketing strategy and seminar positioning must be adopted in order to draw adequate event sign-ups.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Most of the time, event organizers who have large budgets will turn to above the line marketing such as newspaper and magazine advertisements as well as radio and television advertising to publicize the event. Press releases may also be sent in to major newspapers, in order to create the awareness of the upcoming event. Additionally, large advertising media banners and posters can also be purchased to advertise the event in high human traffic areas. When using print advertising, the specific magazine or newspaper used must have the target audience of your event as their primary readership base. Also all print media should be copy written with an enticing approach, highlighting the extensive benefits of participation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
However, if budget is a problem, then below the line marketing may also do wonders. If the event is industry specific, mass faxing to companies belonging to the industry would be feasible. Telemarketing is a very effective marketing channel to create awareness within the right participant group. Additionally, dispatching sales personnel to attend to the requirements of large participant groups is an ideal and effective strategy. Mass emailing has become one of the most cost-efficient methods to reach out to large target audiences. This would be really useful if the event organizer already have an existing database. Otherwise, a list of names can be rented from database companies to attain the same results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Collaboration with sponsors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Getting reputable sponsors to participate in an event will help boost the creditability of the event, as well as reduce costs. Sponsors can also help with marketing, as they also help publicize your event to their customers. Apart from that, some of the sponsors can chip in on venue rental in exchange for exhibition space or publicity for themselves. Some sponsors also require a short message of their company to be given to the participants during the event. Others give away sample products or door gifts to participants.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Managing People and working with speakers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A seminar will not be successful without the people running it, as well as the speakers sharing their knowledge to the participants. Invite speakers who are of caliber and reputation to the event, and who will provide the participants with relevant information to their work, industry or business. Prepare the speakers beforehand and work with them on their Power point presentations as well as pre-inform them of the logistics processes, timing as well as the expected audience size. Check with them on any special requests, such as the requirement for an overhead projector or additional microphones to be used for question and answer sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
All events require a good team of people handling tasks on ushering, registration, customer service as well as handling financials. Familiarize the team with any required event protocol to eliminate the possibility of confusion or error. In order to ensure smooth implementation, each person should be familiar with their individual roles. This can be ensured through a preparation of a detailed schedule of events coupled with roles and responsibilities for each person. Ideally, a project manager should control the whole team and ensure that everyone is carrying out their duties efficiently. Apart from that, the project manager also has the delegated authority to deal with all parties such as the venue management as well as the sponsors and event exhibitors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Actual Day - Preparation, Registration, Ushering, Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All seminar planning and preparations, constituting 80% of total work involved, cascade to the actual event which may last only for a few hours or a few days. On the day before the event, visit the venue to ensure that everything is in order according the requirements and specifications. Microphones, projectors, audio and video systems must be all checked to be in excellent working order. Over at the office, have a packing list prepared and get all require items transferred to the actual venue at least a day before the event. Event staff should be dispatched to work on site preparations, including setting up booths, decorations and posters, the day before the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the actual day, staff should be present at the venue at least 1 &amp;frac12; hours before commencement. They should report to their duty stations and must be ready to receive participants half an hour before they are scheduled to file in. Registrations must be made at the door to ensure authorized access. Name tags, door gifts and event schedules or booklets will be given out at this point and ushers will show participants to their seats in the event hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staff will also be responsible for providing advice or help to participants during the event. Finally, feedback forms should be distributed and then collected from participants to determine the satisfaction level on all aspects of the event experience. This is in order to receive pointers, ideas and advice for future improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming is a common technique used in project management planning to generate ideas and solutions for a project. It involves bringing together a group of people, encouraging them to think creatively, and capturing all of the ideas that are generated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some best practices for conducting a brainstorming session in the context of project management planning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define the problem or opportunity: Before conducting a brainstorming session, it&amp;#39;s important to clearly define the problem or opportunity that the project is addressing. This will help to focus the brainstorming session and ensure that the ideas generated are relevant and aligned with the project&amp;#39;s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Assemble a diverse group of people: Brainstorming is most effective when it involves a diverse group of people with different backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise. This will help to generate a wide range of ideas, and it will ensure that all perspectives are considered.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Encourage creative thinking: The goal of a brainstorming session is to generate as many ideas as possible, so it&amp;#39;s important to encourage creative thinking. This could involve using techniques such as lateral thinking, mind mapping, or the &amp;quot;six hats&amp;quot; method to stimulate creativity and encourage participants to think outside of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Capture all ideas: During the brainstorming session, make sure to capture all of the ideas that are generated. This could involve using a whiteboard or flipchart, or using a digital tool such as a shared document or online whiteboard. It&amp;#39;s important to capture all of the ideas, even if they seem impractical or unrealistic, as they may provide the seeds for more practical and achievable solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Evaluate and prioritize the ideas: After the brainstorming session, it&amp;#39;s important to evaluate and prioritize the ideas that were generated. This could involve using a decision-making framework, such as the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology, to evaluate the ideas based on their feasibility, cost, and potential impact. The most promising ideas can then be prioritized and included in the project plan.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conducting a brainstorming session is a valuable tool for project management planning, as it can help to generate a wide range of ideas and perspectives that can be used to inform the project plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brainstorming is a free-form approach to examining as broad a range of options as possible. Its most effective use is for developing ideas or identifying issues. A successful brainstorming session&amp;nbsp;lets people be as creative as possible and does not restrict their ideas in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are certain guidelines that should be followed during a brainstorming session to ensure that it is productive and effective&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Encourage everyone to participate; do not hold back on any ideas, even if they seem silly at the time; the more ideas the better.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No sidebar discussions during the brainstorming session. That will come later.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No judgment. No one can criticize another&amp;#39;s ideas, not even with a groan or grimace!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Let people hitchhike --- build upon ideas generated by others in the group.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Write all ideas on a flip chart so the whole group can easily scan them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Sequence of Events&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Review the topic, defining the subject of the brainstorming session. Often this process is done best as a &amp;quot;why&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;how,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; question, (&amp;quot;How many different ways can we define this issue?&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Give everyone a minute or two of silence to think about the question.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Go around the room to allow each person to call out one idea or issue at a time. Keep going around the room until everyone runs out of ideas. If a person that is called upon does not have an idea, he/she may pass. The meeting facilitator should enforce the ground rules (&amp;quot;No discussion! Next idea...&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One participant or the facilitator should write down all ideas on the flip chart, pausing only to check accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;h2&gt;Issue Management&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue resolution is an important aspect of project management because it helps to ensure that problems and challenges are addressed and resolved in a timely and effective manner. This can have a positive impact on the overall success of a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective issue resolution involves identifying and addressing issues as they arise, rather than letting them fester and potentially impact the project negatively. This can be done through regular communication with team members, as well as the use of tools such as project management software and issue tracking systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once an issue is identified, it is important to prioritize it based on its potential impact on the project. The issue should then be assigned to a team member or group who is responsible for resolving it. This team should work to identify the root cause of the issue and come up with a plan for addressing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resolution of the issue should be closely monitored to ensure that it is being handled effectively. This may involve regular check-ins with the team responsible for resolving the issue, as well as regular updates to the project manager and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, effective issue resolution is an important part of successful project management. By addressing issues quickly and effectively, project managers can help to ensure that their projects are completed on time and within budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is it an Issue?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the dynamic and fast pace of changes on projects, there is a need for a centralized clearinghouse for all issues related to a project. The centralized &lt;strong&gt;issue management&lt;/strong&gt; clearinghouse is used to capture and prioritize each issue.&amp;nbsp;A common issue log database facilitates open communication between the project management and project stakeholders. In order to achieve the maximum benefit from an issue log,&amp;nbsp;a set of procedures&amp;nbsp;should be created to manage issues as they arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Issue Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once captured, issues need to be assigned to the appropriate team and prioritized. This will facilitate quick and concise communications between the Client and project management regarding the development status and the status of all issues that (may) affect it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receive Issues&lt;/strong&gt; - All requests for work between project management and the client&amp;nbsp;should be documented as an issue. Issues can be received by any contacts such as electronic mail, phone calls, faxes, or mailed requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to issues created by the Client, project personnel&amp;nbsp;should also create issues in the database for Review. Any updates to the issue, including any changes, re-interpretations, clarifications, or decision happening out side the database&amp;nbsp;should be documented in the issue resolution database to ensure proper handling and resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize Issues&lt;/strong&gt; - Based on input from the issue creator, project management&amp;nbsp;should assign a priority to each issue. The priority&amp;nbsp;should be used once the issue has been reviewed and categorized.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review Issues&lt;/strong&gt; - Project Management&amp;nbsp;should review each new issue and assign the issue into one of the following six issue categories (This list can be modified to fit the needs of the project):
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Functional Bugs (Not working as defined)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Content Changes&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Stability and Performance Issues (Requires specialized skill set to resolve)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Site Enhancements (Changes to functional definition of site)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Research Request (Requires specialized skill set to resolve)&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Process change (new reporting requirements, status call changes, distribution list changes)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assign Issues&lt;/strong&gt; - The issue&amp;nbsp;should be assigned to the appropriate team members. Once an issue has been assigned to a team, it is the responsibility of each team manager to monitor and resolve issues in their area. The Project Manager is responsible for monitoring the success of the issue resolution process.&amp;nbsp; Issues will be associated with a project. It is up to the project manager to review each issue and determine if a scope change is required. Any issues that affect budget or schedule must have a scope change document approved that covers the change that the issues creates.&amp;nbsp; Multiple issues can be covered by a single scope change document.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolve Issues - &lt;/strong&gt;The issue&amp;nbsp;is considered resolved when all points have been addressed and any modifications validated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Issue Status Codes Defined&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Outstanding&lt;/strong&gt; - An issue has been reported and is awaiting review/assignment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assigned&lt;/strong&gt; - The issue is assigned to a resource, however work has not started on the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Progress&lt;/strong&gt; - The issues is actively being worked on.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Awaiting Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; - The issues is requires a business decision on the appropriate response.&amp;nbsp; All work is suspended pending feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready To Test&lt;/strong&gt; - The issue has been fixed and the fix in an environment for the owner to test and validate the issue has been resolved. All work has been suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolved&lt;/strong&gt; - The owner and assignee agree that the issue has been resolved. All work is suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not Reproducible&lt;/strong&gt; - The Assignee has been unable to&amp;nbsp;reproduce the reported problem. The owner has been consulted and concurs with the assignee that the problem is not reproducible. All work is suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold&lt;/strong&gt; - This issue has been placed on hold by either the owner or assignee. All work is suspended.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rejected&lt;/strong&gt; - This issue has been rejected by the assignee as not an issue. All work is suspended.&lt;/li&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;h2&gt;Importance of Issue Tracking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an effective issue capture form is an important part of managing issues in a project. This form can help project managers and team members to identify, track, and resolve issues in a timely and effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an issue capture form, start by identifying the key information that needs to be included. This may include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A brief description of the issue&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The date and time the issue was identified&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The name of the person who identified the issue&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The location or area of the project where the issue was identified&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The potential impact of the issue on the project&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Any other relevant information, such as the root cause of the issue or potential solutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once this information has been identified, the next step is to create the form itself. This can be done using a word processing or spreadsheet program, or with the help of a project management software tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating the form, make sure to use a clear and concise format that is easy to understand and fill out. Consider using visual aids, such as checklists or drop-down menus, to make it easier for team members to provide the necessary information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the form has been created, it should be distributed to all team members and stakeholders involved in the project. This will allow them to easily submit any issues they identify, and will ensure that all issues are tracked and addressed in a consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, an effective issue capture form is an important tool for project managers looking to identify, track, and resolve issues in a timely and effective manner. By creating a clear and concise form, project managers can ensure that all issues are captured and addressed effectively, helping to ensure the success of their project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issues are captured using the Issue Capture Form within an issue tracking system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Here is an example of an issue tracking form definition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REQUIRED fields:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue Datetime&lt;/strong&gt; - Date and time that issue was recorded.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue Status&lt;/strong&gt; - Choice list from code table called &amp;quot;IssueStatus&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirement &lt;/strong&gt;- Project Requirement that owns issue&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue Title&lt;/strong&gt; - Free form text field to describe issue&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priority&lt;/strong&gt; - Choice list from code table &amp;quot;Priority&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt; - Choice list from code table called &amp;quot;IssueType&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assigned To&lt;/strong&gt; - Primary contact for issue resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owner&lt;/strong&gt; - The person reporting the issue, will be the primary contact to validate issue resolution&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owner Phone&lt;/strong&gt; - Owner preferred contact phone number&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description of Issue&lt;/strong&gt; - Text field for details about the issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OPTIONAL fields:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimated Hours&lt;/strong&gt; - Choice list to estimate how many hours the issue will require to resolve&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remaining &lt;/strong&gt;- Estimate of how many more hours will be required to resolve issue.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complete Date&lt;/strong&gt; - Date issue is closed (status of Resolved, Not Recreatable, Hold, or Rejected)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution&lt;/strong&gt; - Text field to describe issue resolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Accurately estimating a project&amp;#39;s effort, duration, and the cost is one of the most challenging tasks for the Project Manager. At the project start, the Project Manager usually develops macro-level estimates. As the project progresses, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is refined. A macro-level estimate is used for preliminary planning, creating a global view, and determining project feasibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen people use a flat overhead rate (anywhere between 10-25% depending on what the project sponsor will tolerate) or try to add PM tasks to the project plan to build in hours (meetings(client and team), status reports, issue management, and other activities). &amp;nbsp;My off-the-cuff answer is 20 percent of the total effort will be related to managing the project and not doing the work. This varies widely depending on the skills of the team, the definition of the work to be done, and the effective change management system&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Project Estimating &amp;#39;rules of thumb&amp;#39;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td style="width:168px"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimum 25%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td style="width:367px"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The minimum effort required for project management tasks is 25% (10 Hours per week).&amp;nbsp; That is the time required for a one-person software development effort.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td style="width:168px"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 requires 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td style="width:367px"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Current studies indicate that the maximum number of people that one manager can effectively lead is seven.&amp;nbsp; Therefore, if you are managing seven people, you should allocate 100% of your time to handling project management tasks.&amp;nbsp; Ignoring this requirement is one reason why so many software development efforts are so poorly managed.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td style="width:168px"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smaller Groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td style="width:367px"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If a project consists of more than seven people, consider breaking it up into smaller groups.&amp;nbsp; Assign a &amp;quot;lead&amp;quot; that has management responsibility and authority for the group.&amp;nbsp; Then, use your time to coordinate group efforts, build teams, work with the client, work with management, and plan ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Some common Estimating Mistakes and how to avoid them:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expenses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not forget to include expenses in your estimates.&amp;nbsp; Use a successful project as a template to make sure that you list everything you will need.&amp;nbsp; Have someone audit your spreadsheets to ensure that all lines are totaled properly.&amp;nbsp; A good guide to ensure that you have included all relevant expenses is the Project Initiation Checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contingency&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not skimp on the contingency estimate.&amp;nbsp; If you estimate six months plus one month of contingency, quote seven months plus contingency.&amp;nbsp; The bottom line is nobody is perfect at estimating.&amp;nbsp; No matter how detailed the estimate, Mr. Murphy will come along to ensure that there are delays and things that were not considered.&amp;nbsp; The average contingency ranges from 10% on a small project to 30% on larger and riskier projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Management Hours/Staff Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management hours and staff meeting hours are often underestimated.&amp;nbsp; A weekly two-hour meeting by a five-person team constitutes 40 hours per month.&amp;nbsp; People tend to cut back on these hours because the estimates look high.&amp;nbsp; If you want a smaller number, break up the meetings into more discrete tasks performed in the meetings.&amp;nbsp; There is no way to avoid having the meeting if the project is to stay well-managed, so be sure to include the time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proficiency Assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a team of 15, you can assume that 5-7 of your consultants/associates will be inexperienced.&amp;nbsp; Estimate them to perform at a 50% proficiency level for the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administrative Time&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administrative time (i.e. preparing reports, attending meetings, conveying decisions, reviewing surveys, etc&amp;hellip;) is often omitted from estimates, yet it is still required.&amp;nbsp; If a lump sum is inappropriate to show on the WBS, then show the time broken out into discrete tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supervision Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time required to supervise employees and monitor their development activities is often grossly underestimated.&amp;nbsp; This underestimation is particularly acute in the early stages of a project where new consultants/associates require a material amount of supervision to keep on track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managers Doing &amp;quot;Real Work&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As projects grow in size, the job of running a project soon takes nearly full-time management commitment to managerial tasks.&amp;nbsp; Do not assume that a Manager can be expected to complete deliverables (creating detailed design documents, programming modules, executing test cases, etc.) while managing the project.&amp;nbsp; Consider the size and scope of the project along with the corresponding management tasks to determine whether a Project Manager will be able to undertake these &amp;quot;real&amp;rdquo; tasks.&amp;nbsp; In any case, the assigning of non-management tasks to the Project Manager should be seen as a &amp;quot; red flag&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resource Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assumptions of sharing do not allow for odd numbers of staff.&amp;nbsp; Remember to round up to whole numbers.&amp;nbsp; For example, if there are three resources on an out-of-town project, and one car is allocated for every two staff, two cars will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Access&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A common area of misestimating is the assumption that the client has the appropriate network in place for development.&amp;nbsp; Often the client has unreasonable expectations as to how quickly LAN/network&amp;nbsp;hardware and installation can occur.&amp;nbsp; If the client&amp;#39;s staff is supposed to perform the installation work, be sure to develop a contingency plan to account for delays in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrong Development Tool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, the wrong tool is used for the basis of estimation (e.g., the&amp;nbsp;estimate was based upon Visual Basic, and Visual C++ is required).&amp;nbsp; This situation occurs whenever the requirements are not fully known at the start.&amp;nbsp; Be sure to include an assumption specifying the need to potentially re-estimate should there be a substantive change in the development tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Tuning Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to include time for tuning.&amp;nbsp; Often extensive tuning is required as programs are moved out of development and into testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Transition Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often, development estimates only include time for personnel to be on-site through testing.&amp;nbsp; However, it is frequently a requirement that some staff is available to assist the client in the transition to the new production system.&amp;nbsp; If your estimate does not include transition time, be sure to make a specific exclusion of such assistance in the Job Arrangement Letter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The creation of documentation and help text can be very time-consuming.&amp;nbsp; Even if the actual creation of the documentation and help text is not part of the project deliverables, you will need to include time to assist whoever is responsible for its development.&amp;nbsp; The client will assume that this &amp;quot;assistance&amp;quot; will be minimal and, therefore, will not require specific time allocated to it.&amp;nbsp; If the client does have this sentiment, make sure to secure a separate time and materials agreement for all time spent &amp;quot;assisting&amp;quot; in the preparation of documentation for the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assumptions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to document all estimating assumptions specifically listing all exclusions.&amp;nbsp; Also, be sure to explicitly state those items for which the client is responsible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;h3&gt;Collecting Project Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting project requirements is an important step in the project management process. It helps to ensure that the project is well-defined and that all stakeholders are on the same page. There are several steps that can be followed to collect project requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Identify stakeholders: The first step is to identify all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project or who have a vested interest in its outcome. This may include team members, customers, vendors, and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Define the project scope: The project scope outlines the boundaries of the project, including what will be included and what will be excluded. It helps to ensure that the project stays on track and that all stakeholders understand what is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Gather requirements: There are several methods that can be used to gather requirements, including interviews, focus groups, surveys, and document analysis. These methods can help to identify the needs and expectations of stakeholders and ensure that they are incorporated into the project.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Document requirements: It is important to document all requirements in a clear and concise manner. This can be done using a requirements document or a project charter.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Validate requirements: It is important to validate the requirements to ensure that they are accurate, complete, and feasible. This can be done through a review process or through the use of prototypes or mock-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By following these steps, project managers can effectively collect and document project requirements, which will help to ensure the success of the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A requirement is the description of an activity or deliverable. A requirement explains what will be done or created. While identifying and &lt;strong&gt;collecting requirements&lt;/strong&gt;, associate one or more of the following to the requirement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assignment - A contact is assigned to a requirement. The assignment has dates and estimated efforts. A single requirement can have many assignments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Issue - Issues are&amp;nbsp;connected&amp;nbsp;to requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Functional Specification - A functional specification is a document to describe the functional details of this requirement. These can be simple descriptions or full Use Cases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;User Interface Designs - The user interface describes how the requirement will be presented on the screen and may include design&amp;nbsp;comps or mocked-up screen shots&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Time - Time entries are always allocated to a requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;h2&gt;Team Environment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to create the appropriate &amp;ldquo;team&amp;rdquo; environment.&amp;nbsp; For every project, the specific skills and resources required to achieve the project&amp;#39;s goals will vary, but in forming any team, it is essential to apply several basic principles and methods.&amp;nbsp; It is the responsibility of project management not only to select the team, but also emphasize the values that will produce a quality team environment.&amp;nbsp; Below is a list of the core values that should be embraced within a successful team:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Trust&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fairness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assumed Competence&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Respect&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mentoring Approach&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lead from the Front, Not from the Rear&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stress Quality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stress the Assumption of Responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reach Consensus on Goals and Obtain Commitment to Meet Them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A project manager is the focal point for creating a strong team environment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Leadership Through Empowerment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An effective leader is an individual who leads others to lead themselves.&amp;nbsp; The key tools used by an effective leader are delegation and empowerment.&amp;nbsp; It has been said that if you empower fools you will get foolish decisions faster, but without empowerment you can never recognize the fools from effective performers.&amp;nbsp; The goal should be to remove the fools and, through mentoring, elevate others to top performer status.&amp;nbsp; Without delegation and empowerment, it is impossible for an organization to leverage its resources to achieve greater success.&amp;nbsp; Several key points to apply when empowering team members:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Be fair and just&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Emphasize freedom as part of growth&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make commitments and keep them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Consult with associates before any action that may adversely affect the reputation or financial stability of the team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delegation Capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two key aspects of delegation are monitoring and mentoring.&amp;nbsp; A characteristic of delegation supervision is that changes in direction are suggested instead of dictated, and courses of action are encouraged instead of forced.&amp;nbsp; This process of delegation and empowerment will reveal the team&amp;rsquo;s inadequate performers.&amp;nbsp; It is essential for leaders to remove these individuals without hesitation.&amp;nbsp; Though it may be clich&amp;eacute;, the saying holds true, &amp;ldquo;A bad apple will ruin the barrel&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Project Atmosphere&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Project Environment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key to the operation of a successful team environment is to provide the appropriate physical environment for performing tasks.&amp;nbsp; This environment should be free of noise and outside distractions and provide appropriate space for the project tasks.&amp;nbsp; Proper lighting, equipment, and air-conditioning are critical, as well as sufficient space for storage and retrieval of project resources.&amp;nbsp; Team members should have immediate access to the tools required for completion of their tasks, and they should not be responsible for installations unless that effort is described as part of their task list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Individual Tasks&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team members should have well-defined and distinctly scheduled tasks.&amp;nbsp; Do not allow excessive task overlap, and ensure that team members remain focused on their most critical tasks.&amp;nbsp; Team members should feel a sense of ownership over their work and benefit from the satisfaction of seeing the completion of their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Knowledge Sharing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important for team members to exchange knowledge and openly benefit from informal training and learning opportunities.&amp;nbsp; Members in leadership roles should mentor and provide &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; reviews of work on an informal basis in order to increase both the quantity and quality of the sharing of knowledge.&amp;nbsp; It is also critical that all team members be aware of (and respect) the differences in skills and experience between project members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Quality Work&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal should be for all team members to produce work at the best of their ability, and have their abilities mature over the course of the project.&amp;nbsp; To achieve this goal, Project Managers must promote an environment focused on quality.&amp;nbsp; It is important to emphasize an attention to both quantity and quality in the effort, and the finished product.&amp;nbsp; Team members must feel that they are an integral part of the project and not just &amp;ldquo;Doing a job&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Communication/Groupware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-Access Forum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons for the implementation of a Notes environment on Company projects is the need for an open forum in which team members can communicate issues, publish solutions, and share knowledge.&amp;nbsp; Notes databases are intended to compliment other team communications methods such as meetings, informal discussions, e-mail, etc&amp;hellip; but it can also serve to reduce the need for these other forms of communications that often occur without documentation or resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Repeatable Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One advantage facilitated by the use of database templates in Notes is the ability to create a standard project management toolkit for the rapid and generic deployment of a project Notes environment.&amp;nbsp; These toolkits reduce the time required for implementation of reporting and documentation standards, and additionally provide a familiar environment for consultants moving from one project to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotes and Simplifies Documentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web provides many simple tools for facilitating technical and functional discussions, while additionally creating an ongoing archive for project material.&amp;nbsp; The storage of discussion, status reports, change forms, document attachments, and common objects allows teams to communicate openly without dedicating additional effort for documenting the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increases Team Bonding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of project specific discussion databases (with access limited to team members) provides a forum in which team members can actively apply many of the core team values.&amp;nbsp; Discussion databases are well suited to mentoring and consensus.&amp;nbsp; General Discussion databases will also provide an outlet for the team to blow of steam and build stronger relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hallmarks of a Good Leader&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Conduct Periodic Project Team Outings&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is critical that team members be treated to periodic outings in which they may blow off steam and spend time together outside of the work environment.&amp;nbsp; These outings could be in the form of lunches, dinners, happy hours, etc&amp;hellip;&amp;nbsp; While the Project Manager should arrange these outings, they do not always have to be funded by the Project Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Team Member Departures When Appropriate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When long-term team members move off the project (whether to new projects or out of the company), provide a celebration to recognize them for their accomplishments.&amp;nbsp; This celebration serves to boost the departing individual&amp;#39;s morale, and it also gives other team members a chance to interact socially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate Successful Project Completion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after highly successful projects, team members often feel a profound sense of loss that must be brought to a ceremonial conclusion.&amp;nbsp; The longer the project, the deeper the sense of loss felt by the team.&amp;nbsp; Celebrate the success and let that be the lasting memory, not the packing of boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address &amp;ldquo;What was learned&amp;rdquo; for Unsuccessful Projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to bring closure to unsuccessful projects with a lunch or dinner to facilitate a &amp;ldquo;What was Learned&amp;rdquo; discussion.&amp;nbsp; This process is cathartic in nature, and helps team members openly discuss areas for improvement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not be &amp;ldquo;One of the Guys&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most common mistakes made by Project Managers is to behave as if they are still &amp;ldquo;one of the guys&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp; The result of this behavior is to produce an imbalance of power between the Project Manager and the project team members.&amp;nbsp; Managers must perform a number of tasks that place them hierarchically above the project team members.&amp;nbsp; By establishing an authoritative role above the other project team members, Project Managers are able to effectively perform the following tasks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Making Tough Decisions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Handling Personnel Problems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assuring Project Success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of mistake can occur in any organization, but is particularly acute in organizations with a flat organizational structure such as that currently employed at Company.&amp;nbsp; When the organization structure emphasizes a team environment without title differentiation, it is much simpler for managers to assume they are on the same level as the team members are.&amp;nbsp; The flat organization structure facilitates better communication within the overall organization, but this structure does not always translate well the project environment where a defined management role must be filled and clarified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Attend Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often managers fail to recognize that an important part of their job is to attend meetings.&amp;nbsp; In order to continually influence and lead team members, the manager must attend meetings and participate in the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember to Delegate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For larger projects, it is critical to the success of the project that the Project Manager effectively delegates responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;So, when starting out to build a Web API with ASP.Net you first need to do some resarch on best practices and get an idea of how you are going to implment it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Background Research Links:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft API implementation guidance: &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-api-implementation"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-api-implementation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling a Web API From a .NET Client (C#) :&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best practice for creating HttpClient and calling an API: &lt;a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/111882/clean-call-api-from-client-with-good-practice"&gt;http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/111882/clean-call-api-from-client-with-good-practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete Example for Error Handlers: &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397417.aspx"&gt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397417.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a generic asp.net error handling article, good background, not specific to API or MVC calling an API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exception Handling in ASP.NET Web API Application: &lt;a href="https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/the-asp-net-web-api-exception-handling-pipeline-a-guided-tour/"&gt;https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/the-asp-net-web-api-exception-handling-pipeline-a-guided-tour/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is things we can do in the API to make our errors more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Integrate Distributed &amp;nbsp;Web Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Project Mechanics Web Services" src="/sites/ProjectMechanics/img/projectmechanics-ws.gif" style="float:left; height:72px; width:138px" /&gt;No matter where or how you choose to publish Project Mechanics can&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;integrate and distribute your content into a unified site&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;nbsp; Your website is the information hub for all your distributed web content. &amp;nbsp;The communication options have exploded, now your website needs to integrate YouTube, Facebook, &amp;nbsp;Twitter, Email Newsletters, Google Calendar, Blogs, and Flickr Feeds seamlessly into a unified experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To find out more review the &lt;a href="/project-mechanics-case-studies"&gt;Project Mechanics Case Studies&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; There is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="/resources"&gt;Resources&lt;/a&gt; section as an information resource focused on project management basics. In this section, you will find articles and outlines of good project management practices. We hope you find it useful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://wpm.codeplex.com"&gt;Web Project Mechanics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a web platform developed by Project Mechanics for small organisations to create web sites. It is designed as a basic web content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Project Mechanics is hosted at CodePlex.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Project Mechanics (WPM) is a Dot.Net based Web Content Management system  developed written in VB.Net using an access database. It is developed using  vb.net. This project came about after I created many website for  various companies and individuals. The goal was a system that would  quickly create a website&amp;nbsp;and maintain it over time without have to touch the  file system.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The project appraoch&amp;nbsp;is a&amp;nbsp;tool to generate complete HTML pages  from a database. WPM&amp;nbsp;uses templates and in line tags as a way to separate content and presentation.&amp;nbsp; The presentation template is stored as marked up HTML in the database allowing for&amp;nbsp;customization via a web interface.&amp;nbsp; The goal was to create a site that could be handed over to a non-technical user to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WPM is currently being used by over 100 web sites.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;I recently found a project on sourceforge which is 100% java based and does a very good job of generating gantt charts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It uses an XML based file system to store all information on the project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It allows you to work on one project at a time, but given the ease of use and extensive reporting features, it is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ganttproject.sourceforge.net/" target="_new"&gt;http://ganttproject.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;P&gt;Weather got a big colder on tueday, had to re-adjust the heat,&amp;nbsp; just another false alarm for spring.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Well, now that I am up and running with a BLOG that has an RSS feed, I now need a news reader.&amp;nbsp; I have added it today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have created a database table to hold the feeds so I keep the information 'fresh' without having to hit the RSS feed all the time.&amp;nbsp; The frequency is configurable.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I still need to create the maintance screens and the ability for each user to customize which feeds appear on which pages. &lt;/P&gt;</LocationBody>

I used the technique that requires you to have 2 pages, one for the box and one for the results.&amp;nbsp; Instead of just one page for the box, I have placed it on every page.&amp;nbsp; The results page uses IFrames to return the results, along with some ads (no such thing as a free lunch).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Never one to be on the bleeding edge, I have finally decided to create a Web 2.0 section of ProjectMechanics to highlight some great tools and trends in the industry.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have been working on a couple of Web 2.0ish things, including testing out the &lt;a href="http://astore.amazon.com/projectmechanics-20"&gt;new Amazon aStore&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;funtionality.&amp;nbsp; On my &lt;a href="http://www.lakeclaibornehouse.com"&gt;LakeClaiborneHouse&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;site I was trying out the functionality that Flickr can provide with real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of stuff to look at and try, what will actually stick is still to be determined.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;. .&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Based on the success of my &lt;a href="http://www.lakeclaibornehouse.com"&gt;Lake Claiborn House&lt;/a&gt; site to sell our lake house, I have added my profile to &lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/profile/markhazleton"&gt;Zillow &lt;/a&gt;.  The opportunity for localized sites is increasing as search engines seek to find more relevant results for local searches.&amp;nbsp; This is a great opportunity to create a unique site that highlights not only your property, but the surrounding area as well. If you need to a site to market your house or property, I can help you bring buyers to your door.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created the following real estate based sites&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.lakeclaibornehouse.com"&gt;LakeClaiborneHouse.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;I have added the ability to have multiple 'skins' for the web site.&amp;nbsp; I was inspired by some of the DHTML sites, including, &lt;a href="http://www.csszengarden.com"&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which allows people to develop their own CSS files and upload them on the site.&amp;nbsp; Another site that is great for showing what can be done with DHTML is &lt;a href="http://www.dhtmlcentral.com/"&gt;DHTML Central&lt;/a&gt; (which is the home of CoolMenus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out some of the 'skins' that this site can have by going to the &lt;a href="/runtime/skin_switch.aspx"&gt;skin switch page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These skins are achieved&amp;nbsp;by defining styles using CSS.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the Top and Bottom code for the site is also maintained.&amp;nbsp;The values are stored in a database and can be changed on the fly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="a20a616b-fb85-4d4f-b42f-a41764bb528b" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="8adfc96b-91f5-4999-b687-ce3c4cb4e6e6" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"&gt;Site&lt;/span&gt; components are added to the template using a custom tagging system.&amp;nbsp; This includes navigation, titles, and copyright notices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the templates use the more traditional method of nested tables to achieve the desired layout.&amp;nbsp; There are others which&amp;nbsp;is pure CSS using &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; tags&amp;nbsp;instead of tables. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;I have started a soft launch of &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/wpm" target="_blank"&gt;Web Project Mechanics (WPM) on Codeplex&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I am taking the web content management system that I have used for many clients and turning it into a project, then I will evolve it into a product. &amp;nbsp;Right now, the source is a collection of requirments from many clients and projects. &amp;nbsp;I have been able to unify most of my clients onto the current version of the tool. &amp;nbsp;At this time there are over 100 sites runing WPM. &amp;nbsp;While not a fully-fleged product, the code base is over 4 years old and has been reworked numerous times. &amp;nbsp;The big challange now is to create a product from many successful projects. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Project Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Project Mechanics is a Dot.Net based Web Content Management system developed written in VB.Net using an access database. It is developed using vb.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project came about after I created many website for various companies and individuals. The goal was a system that would allow me to quickly create a website, and maintain it over time without have to touch the file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached this project as a tool to create HTML pages from a database. I used templates as a way to separate content and presentation. I wanted to be able to swap skins of a site very quickly. My goal was to create a site that I could hand over to a non-technical user to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application is currently being used by over 100 web sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application is currently being modified to be more of a packaged product. A formal release plan and product road map is currently under development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to participate, please contact Mark.Hazleton@projectmechanics.com &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I was able to get an invite to the new Yahoo meme service. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/georgedearing"&gt;GeorgeDearing&lt;/a&gt; for the invite. For a detailed breakdown of the service I reccomend goiing to &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yahoo_meme_hands-on_with_yahoos_twitter_clone.php" target="_blank"&gt;ReadWriteWeb&lt;/a&gt; for thier excellent review. &amp;nbsp; Here are a few of my early thoughts after a small amount of time with meme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t Yahoo a little late to the party on this? &amp;nbsp;Seems like the micro-blogging attention is between Facebook and Twitter, with Facebook now in posissen of my favorite micro-bloggint tool FrieldFeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When do we get back to usability over coolness. &amp;nbsp;Web application should not be like playing a game of Mist, &amp;quot;Hmmm. &amp;nbsp;I wonder what this does?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One big win for meme over twitter is the better linking of posts/replies. &amp;nbsp;I have always wanted more of a threaded discussion so I can follow a converstaion more easily. &amp;nbsp; Nice to have that ability when I want it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Friday is here.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hope you didn&amp;#39;t get fooled too much yesterday. I got the new PC Magazine and I have been checking out the many sites listed on their &lt;a href="http://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1738,7488,00.asp" target="_new"&gt;100 Best Undiscovered Web Sites&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spent&amp;nbsp; way too much time on the site reviews.&amp;nbsp; Here are the sites that I really liked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.musicplasma.com" target="_new"&gt;Musicplasma.com&lt;/a&gt; - Interesting interface, must say that I do not always agree with the&amp;nbsp;relative size of the artists, guess I&amp;#39;m too much of an independant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.filmaffinity.com" target="_new"&gt;FilmAffinity.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Was really fun to rate a bunch of movies, found a few that I will need to see soon.&amp;nbsp; However, my &amp;quot;movie soulmates&amp;quot; are all from Spain; What does that mean?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.turnerclassicmovies.com" target="_new"&gt;TurnerClassicMovies.com&lt;/a&gt; - Great trailers and content, even though I have not been a watcher of the channel, I really liked the site.&lt;/li&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft SharePoint&lt;/strong&gt; is a popular web platform developed by Microsoft for small to large organizations. It is designed as a centralized replacement for multiple web applications and supports various combinations of enterprise website requirements. It is typically associated with web content management and document management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharePoint&amp;#39;s multi-purpose platform allows for the managing and provisioning of intranet portals, extranets and websites, document management and file management, collaboration spaces, social networking tools, enterprise search, business intelligence tooling, process/information integration, and third-party developed solutions. SharePoint can also be used as a web application development platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharePoint is designed to be highly scalable. It is capable of supporting multiple organizations on a single &amp;#39;server farm&amp;#39;. Microsoft provides SharePoint as a free product, it sells premium editions with additional integration and functionality, and it also provides SharePoint as a cloud computing solution as part of Office 365 and BPOS. The product is also often sold as a cloud solution by local third-party vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharePoint provides various methods for the customization and configuration of web areas, all of which have granular governance configurations. Beyond basic page-editing, file-storing and custom design (&amp;#39;branding&amp;#39;) capabilities, one of the more prevalent forms of configuration is the ability to install third-party customizations called &amp;#39;web parts&amp;#39; (i.e. widgets/gadgets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft SharePoint has evolved significantly since its initial release in 2001. Initially designed as a platform for document management and collaboration, SharePoint has expanded to include a wide range of features and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant developments in SharePoint has been its integration with Microsoft Teams. Teams is a cloud-based collaboration and communication platform that allows users to chat, share files, and work on projects together in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the integration of SharePoint and Teams, users can access SharePoint content and features directly within Teams, making it easier to collaborate on documents and projects. This includes the ability to share and edit files, create and manage document libraries, and access and manage SharePoint sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of SharePoint and Teams has also brought new capabilities to SharePoint, such as the ability to create and use custom apps and connectors within Teams. This allows users to customize their experience and integrate SharePoint with other applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the evolution of SharePoint and its integration with Teams has provided users with a more powerful and flexible platform for collaboration and document management. By bringing together the capabilities of SharePoint and Teams, Microsoft has enabled users to work more efficiently and effectively on their projects and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;While working on the template for this site (a never ending process), I came across the YUI Library.  It is a collection of javascript and css to help you create better structured websites. I was able to add the links to my template and clean up my own CSS stylesheet.  I have been pleased with the results, and plan to continue to modify my template to take advantage of all the library has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX. The YUI Library also includes several core CSS resources. All components in the YUI Library have been released as open source under a &lt;a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.txt"&gt;BSD license&lt;/a&gt; and are free for all uses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <LocationDescription>Conflict is inevitable in any team environment.  Today's project teams bring together a variety of personality and skills, each perceiving tasks and actions is in different ways. An article on how Project Managers can address conflict.</LocationDescription>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Conflict management is an important skill for project managers to possess, as conflicts are a natural part of any project and can impact the team&amp;#39;s productivity, morale, and overall success.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is inevitable in any&amp;nbsp;team environment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Today&amp;#39;s project teams bring together a variety of personality and skills, each perceiving tasks and actions is in different ways.&amp;nbsp;This diversity is what gives the team depth and broad range of skills required to successfully achieve the project objectives.&amp;nbsp;Yet, this diversity will inevitably bring conflicts ranging from simple disagreements on task details to fundamental personality clashes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply stated,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Conflict&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;the discrepancy between what is the perceived reality of the situation and what the is seen as the ideal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflict can be healthy and will allow participants to expand their understanding of issues and tasks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Applying the&amp;nbsp;appropriate approach to conflict will help manage conflict when it occurs.&amp;nbsp; Encouraging&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;consensus&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;will allow you to increase buy-in from the client and team members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project Managers must consider two aspects of any conflict to successfully mange conflict:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The affect of conflict on the personal relationship between participants&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The affect conflict will have on the tasks being performed on the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to foster strong relationships between participants and promote the continued progress toward project objectives, Project Managers will need to employ a variety of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/conflict-resolution"&gt;conflict resolution approaches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Managers will find out &lt;a href="http://projectmechanics.com/community-building/resources/conflict-management/conflict-resolution-techniques" target="_self"&gt;what are the five approaches for conflict resolution&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Managers will also need to recognize the approach that others are employing in order to identify the common ground between individuals involved in a conflict.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is one perspective on Conflict Management&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationDescription>Comparing a corporation's processes and controls to both regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a key component of evaluating risk, process improvement and control automation.</LocationDescription>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;Project Mechanics recently completed an implementation of a Control Analysis Model (CAM).&amp;nbsp; Running inside a BEA AquaLogic&amp;reg; User Interaction Portal. The solution used &lt;a href="/resources/workflow/handysoft-bizflow.html" id="Handysoft" name="Handysoft BizFlow" title="Handysoft BizFlow"&gt;HandySoft BizFlow&lt;/a&gt; work engine to facilitate maintenance of policies and procedures. Once created, the policies and procedures were mapped to both internal and external best practice frameworks. This created the ability for users to view the complete policy and procedure library via multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing a corporation&amp;#39;s processes and controls to both regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a key component of evaluating risk, process improvement and control automation. The ability to analyze the maturity of an organization from a process and control perspective is essential to developing a strategy to increase that level of maturity through the introduction of new technology solutions or new process sourcing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of evaluating enterprise risk should begin with creation of a clear baseline of the current process and control environment. Once defined, the baseline model is initially used to perform a &amp;quot;Gap Analysis&amp;quot; of an organization&amp;rsquo;s process and control hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most organizations rely on consultants, after many hours of interviews, analysis and data entry, to build complex spreadsheets that are used for process and control analysis. In order to manage risk, executives need the ability to define a clear process and control strategy for their enterprise. This model will provide just that capability. Utilizing an advanced control analysis model, the team can rapidly analyze the process and control hierarchy and complete the initial gap analysis process. The analysis will be driven by risk management, leading practices and business requirements that are relevant to your organization&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

Project Mechanics provided the training and implementation of the organization's website.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dearinggroup.com"&gt;The Dearing Group&lt;/a&gt; is dynamic marketing and new media communications&amp;nbsp;company.&amp;nbsp; They help companies weave the internet and web 2.0 technologies into traditional marketing programs to create better customer experiences, increase sales, and expand web visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their clients ask them to do a lot of things.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be marketing, web strategy or support for a difficult project.&amp;nbsp; It's safe to say most of the Dearing Group projects have a web component, involve social media&amp;nbsp; and consistently push the marketing envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dearing Group needed a web presence to serve as a hub for their distributed web content.&amp;nbsp; They publish on several blogs and other social media sites.&amp;nbsp; They needed a way to bring all their content under a single unified brand.&amp;nbsp; Project Mechanics Web Services provided a platform to consolidate content from different sources including Blogs, Twitter, De.licio.us, Flickr, and Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was a site that not only highlighted the many actives of the Dearing Group but also demonstrates how hyper-publishing can be used to get your message out to the public, while maintaining a strong brand stratgey that reinforces rather than dilutes the brand.&lt;/p&gt;

      <LocationBody>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflow&lt;/strong&gt; at its simplest is the movement of tasks through defined process. More specifically, workflow is the operational aspect of a work procedure: how tasks are structured, who performs them, what their relative order is, how they are synchronized, how information flows to support the tasks and how tasks are being tracked. As the dimension of time is considered in Workflow, Workflow considers &amp;quot;throughput&amp;quot; as a distinct measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Workflow Application is where various applications, components and people must be involved in the processing of data to complete an instance of a process. For example, consider a purchase order that moves through various departments for authorization and eventual purchase. The orders may be treated as messages, which are put into various queues for processing. A workflow process involves constant change and update. You can introduce new components into the operation without changing any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the concept of &lt;strong&gt;workflow&lt;/strong&gt; is not specific to information technology, support for workflow is an integral part of any application that processes information across a defined series of steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinction can be made between &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; workflow paradigms. While the former is mostly concerned with throughput of data through various algorithms, applications and services, the latter concentrates on scheduling task executions, including dependencies which are not necessarily data-driven and may include human agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific workflows found wide acceptance in the fields of bioinformatics and cheminformatics in the early 2000s, where they successfully met the need for multiple interconnected tools, handling of multiple data formats and large data quantities. Also, the paradigm of scientific workflows was close to the well-established tradition of Perl scripting in life-science research organizations, so this adoption represented a natural step forward towards a more structured infrastructure setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business workflows &lt;/strong&gt;are more generic, being able to represent any structuring of tasks, and are equally applicable to task scheduling within a software application server and organizing a paper or electronic document trail within an organization. Their origins date back to the 1970s, when they were purely paper-based, and the principles from that period made the transition to modern IT infrastructure systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key driver to gain benefit from the understanding of the workflow process in a business context is that the throughput of the work stream path is modeled in such a way as to evaluate the efficiency of the flow route through internal silos with a view to increasing discrete control of uniquely identified business attributes and rules and reducing potential low efficiency drivers. Evaluation of resources, both physical and human is essential to evaluate hand off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way of bridging the gap between the two, significant effort is being put into defining workflow patterns that can be used to compare and contrast different workflow engines across both of these domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, workflow techniques are appropriate only for work in which human involvement is limited to key data entry and decision points. For innovative, adaptive, collaborative human work the techniques of Human Interaction Management are required.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;blockquote&gt;BizFlow capabilities range from simple market  positioning to features that incorporate a high degree of domain-specific  knowledge. Of particular note are the accounts payable, Sarbanes-Oxley, Six  Sigma and governmental functions. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BizFlow is a full-featured business process management system from &lt;a href="http://www.handysoft.com/"&gt;HandySoft&lt;/a&gt;, a focused BPM product supplier.  BizFlow excels in environments where exceptions or disturbances to  normal processes must be handled quickly and seamlessly, it includes well thought-out capabilities for operation and modification of business processes on  an ongoing basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BizFlow is a stand-alone BPM product and, unlike many products in this space,  is not positioned as a suite of applications. All of the expected interfaces and functions of a full BPM system are included as part of the BizFlow product.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BizFlow is built on cross-platform technology, so customers can run the  system on a variety of hardware and operating systems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) deployed HandySoft&amp;rsquo;s award-winning BPM platform BizFlow&amp;reg; as a part of its department-wide E-Grants initiative.  The DOL is leveraging BizFlow to streamline and automate its annual grant application funds process with the goal of reducing grant turn-around time by 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Workflow Client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The workflow client is an integrated, graphical-design environment typical of  focused BPM products. It is easy to use, and the interface is adequately  designed to allow process modeling without programming. The workflow client also  provides process auditing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual client interface is browser-based, providing the maintenance and  support benefits of such designs. The manual-interface screens require custom  development with an easy-to-use, automated forms application.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manual-client interface includes ad-hoc routing, making it easy for  managers to access and control processes that require decisions about routing  flow or resource assignments. This is particularly important for businesses that  need to make operational decisions in a dynamic working environment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Automation Interface &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automation interface is solid, with support for custom integration and a healthy set of application-specific adapters ready for  plug-and-play integration to selected ERP, EAI and document-management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BizFlow has some excellent integration capabilities which encapsulate domain knowledge to reduce time and effort when implementing  specific business-process scenarios. They range from simple market positioning  capabilities to features that incorporate a high degree of domain-specific  knowledge and automation.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular note are the accounts payable, Sarbanes-Oxley, Six Sigma and  governmental functions. They have real depth and provide substantial value to  customers who need to implement these process flows in their BPM systems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Reporting and Analysis &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporting interface is browser-based, like the manual interface, with the  same I.T. benefits. An excellent set of reports and data views, called &amp;quot;BizCove  Monitors,&amp;quot; is available.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These reports, coupled with BizCove Filters for fine-tuning the information  view to specific needs, make it obvious that HandySoft has a clear understanding  of reporting and analysis requirements. These tools meet those needs &amp;quot;out of the  box&amp;quot; better than most BPM products.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Solid Technology &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BizFlow's technology is solid and extensible, easily qualifying as a  dependable, enterprise-class product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HandySoft, headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, is a global BPM supplier with a  substantial client list and an aggressive growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <LocationBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/sites/ProjectMechanics/img/The Business Process Revision Cycle.gif" alt="The Business Process Revision Cycle" style="float: left;"/&gt;Software that manages work flow is called Business Process Management (BPM).  BPM is as much a philosophy as it is a suite of tools to affect, control, and optimize positive change. BPM serves as a platform through which management can instill change while moving towards full process automation through iterative, insightful revisions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; BPM serves as a management philosophy emphasizing processes and process performance.&amp;nbsp; In addition, BPM defines and supports a strategic approach to organizing company change.&amp;nbsp; In order to be a successful BPM software must provide a suite of methodologies, tools, and templates for defining, modeling, automating, monitoring, and ultimately optimizing business processes.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The underlying BPM Suite of tools combines eight core functional elements: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling&lt;/strong&gt; – Processes follow paths. To optimize a process you have to know who and what is involved. BPM enables analysts to capture a process using modeling tools. &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Rules&lt;/strong&gt; – With the model in hand you know where the process starts and ends. Now you need to add rules on who starts it, what they must add/input, what systems share the work, how data is routed, approved, and stored. That’s where business rules come into play.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forms&lt;/strong&gt; – Normally what is being passed is a document. The goal of any process-driven exercise is to reduce paper and create visibility. Using BPM one can create an electronic form, say a contract for example, they everyone can use through serial or parallel steps to automate work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Interfaces&lt;/strong&gt; – Next we must allow participants to access the form and workflow. BPM provides a way to create a user interface, which in turn can be plugged into a portal for anytime access.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integration&lt;/strong&gt; – Most companies have multiple data repositories. As data is passed, the application process must be able to tap the appropriate data sources for changes, updates, and versioning. So the integration of disparate data sources (e.g., databases, EDMS, ERP, CRM applications) is essential to process automation.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring &amp;amp; Reports&lt;/strong&gt; – All participants should be able to monitor and audit their work. BPM grants management, visibility into process flows. At any given moment they can know who is doing what, how long it has taken, and whether bottlenecks exist. With this knowledge in hand, they can be more proactive in solving issues and getting work done.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt; – BPM tools must secure the overall process. Security consists of software license, authority groups, folder permissions, and data protection and validation. Different groups may have their own territories and assign appropriate permission and user access.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Administration&lt;/strong&gt; – Ultimately, BPM provides a studio to plan and deploy projects. Administration handles roles, access rights, definitions, permissions, and process execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Within these functional elements organizations find additional capabilities that define, simulate, deploy, execute, and optimize their business processes.  &lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

&lt;p&gt;How to deliver on the promise of XML?  For years I have been thinking about how to leverage XML to be able to publish multiple documents from a single complex XML documents.&amp;nbsp; XML makes sense as a tool for publishing.&amp;nbsp; In the project management world, we deal with a myriad of formats for basically the same data.&amp;nbsp; Proposals, Statements of Work, Status Reports, Requirement Documents, Issue Logs, Design Documents, Test Documents. . . the list goes on and on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these use the same set of information over and over again.&amp;nbsp; Yet, most solutions that I have found are locked in the world of Word Templates with a separate document template for each type.&amp;nbsp; This means massive reproduction of data and lots of opportunity for things to get lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can XML-&amp;gt;PDF be the answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some resources I am used to explore this topic further:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=projectmechanics-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=0672322811&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;nou=1"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=projectmechanics-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=0596003552&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;nou=1"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;iframe scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" src="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=projectmechanics-20&amp;amp;o=1&amp;amp;p=8&amp;amp;l=as1&amp;amp;asins=0131403745&amp;amp;fc1=000000&amp;amp;IS2=1&amp;amp;lt1=_blank&amp;amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;amp;bc1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;amp;f=ifr&amp;amp;nou=1"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the project that had the immedate needs, I went with a two part approach.  First, I created the complex XML document by creating data classes, populating then and then saving them as XML.  I then used XSLT to convert the XML to presentation HTML for viewing on the Browser.  For the PDF, I found a great utility which allows me to convert HTML to PDF.  While this solution did not give me as much control over the output as an XSL-FO solution, it was easier to implement and can be used throughout the organization to create PDF of existing HTML&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the solution worked for the current project, I am still hopeful that the quality of tools will continue to improve and make this task easier.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With great power comes great responsiblity&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the relationship between accountability and authority is a key skill of leadership. Accountability refers to the responsibility that an individual or organization has for their actions and decisions. Authority, on the other hand, refers to the power or right to make decisions and take action. Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority and are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others. They also understand that with authority comes responsibility, and they are willing to take ownership of the outcomes of their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leadership requires the ability to understand the relationship between accountability and authority. Accountability refers to the responsibility that an individual or organization has for their actions and decisions. On the other hand, authority refers to the power or right to make decisions and take action. The two concepts are interdependent, and having one without the other can cause frustration and lead to negative outcomes. Effective leaders need to understand the balance between accountability and authority to make informed decisions that align with the goals of the organization and the expectations of stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Accountability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accountability is the responsibility for the outcome of a given action. Teams are measured by what was accomplished rather than what they could have accomplished. Accountability typically comes from an external person or organization. In other words, someone else defines the objectives upon which you will be measured. Accountability implies an obligation to account for the defined activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results of these activities in a transparent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Accountability is a fundamental concept in leadership that refers to the responsibility of an individual or organization for their actions and decisions. Accountability implies an obligation to account for the defined activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results of these activities transparently. Leaders are often held accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions, and they are typically granted a certain level of authority to make those decisions and take those actions. However, accountability also comes from external sources, and someone else defines the objectives upon which leaders will be measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Authority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority is the ability to perform a given action. This ability can be both formally and informally acquired. For instance, the type of authority that is institutionalized in a particular job, function, or position that is meant to enable its holder to successfully carry out his or her responsibilities. This includes a right to command a situation, commit resources, give orders, and expect them to be obeyed. There is also an implanted authority such as a subject matter expert or a long-time member of a team that has much institutional knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Authority refers to the power or right to make decisions and take action. Authority is the ability to perform a given action and can be both formally and informally acquired. For example, the type of authority institutionalized in a particular job, function, or position is meant to enable its holder to successfully carry out his or her responsibilities. It includes the right to command a situation, commit resources, give orders, and expect them to be obeyed. There is also an implanted authority, such as a subject matter expert or a long-time member of a team that has much institutional knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Relationship between Accountability and Authority&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accountability and authority go hand in hand. Having power implies that you will be held accountable for the use of that power. Leaders are often held accountable for the outcomes of their decisions and actions, and they are typically granted a certain level of authority to make those decisions and take those actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accountability without authority can be very frustrating. It is hard to implement any meaningful changes that will improve your likelihood of success if you can&amp;rsquo;t make a decision that will be followed. Non-management team members often fall into this situation. They are accountable for an objective, yet have no direct authority to require a change that they recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opposite situation, authority without accountability, is dangerous and thankfully rare. Simply by being in charge, people assume accountability for the performance of a team. Leaders, however, do not. They can rapidly become disillusioned and perhaps even bitter if they are not given the authority to do the things they will be accountable for. This is especially true if they are held to high standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accountability and authority are closely related concepts. Leaders are granted authority to make decisions and take action, but with that power comes responsibility. Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority and are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others. They understand that accountability and authority are interdependent, and having one without the other can cause frustration and lead to negative outcomes. Accountability without authority can be frustrating, and it is hard to implement meaningful changes that will improve success if one cannot make decisions that will be followed. Authority without accountability is dangerous and creates a situation where people assume accountability for the performance of a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Noblesse Oblige and Jesus&amp;#39;s Parable of the Faithful Servant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of authority and accountability can be traced back to noblesse oblige, a French term that means &amp;quot;nobility obligates.&amp;quot; It is the idea that those who have power and privilege have an obligation to use it responsibly for the benefit of others. This concept is also evident in Jesus&amp;#39;s Parable of the Faithful Servant, where a master entrusts his servants with talents and expects them to use them wisely. The servants who use their talents wisely are rewarded, while the one who fails to use them is punished. These concepts demonstrate that having the power to do something makes one responsible for the use of that power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noblesse Oblige&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of authority and accountability can be traced back to noblesse oblige, a French term that means &amp;quot;nobility obligates.&amp;quot; It is the idea that those who have power and privilege have an obligation to use it responsibly for the benefit of others. The term is commonly associated with the aristocracy, who had a duty to use their wealth and status to help those less fortunate. However, the concept of noblesse oblige extends beyond the aristocracy to anyone in a position of power or privilege.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus&amp;#39;s Parable of the Faithful Servant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of authority and accountability is also evident in Jesus&amp;#39;s Parable of the Faithful Servant, where a master entrusts his servants with talents and expects them to use them wisely. The servants who use their talents wisely are rewarded, while the one who fails to use them is punished. This parable teaches that having the power to do something makes one responsible for the use of that power, and that failure to use it wisely will have consequences. This concept is applicable not only to religious contexts, but also to everyday life, where individuals have different degrees of power and are responsible for using it wisely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Accountability and Authority for Project Leaders&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being on a project team gives many people their first real taste of accountability and authority over others. Project leaders should be aware of this challenge that their team is facing, and work to provide specific coaching on the topic. Try to identify, and change, situations where leaders, especially junior leaders, in your organization are held accountable for things they cannot control. It creates a very frustrating situation that saps job satisfaction. If you are in charge of other leaders, make sure you are clear about your expectations for them. This will actually benefit you while also helping your team. When you grant authority, your subordinate leaders will make decisions. Being clear about how you will hold them accountable helps them use that authority effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The privilege of authority comes with the burden of accountability. It is important to note that authority can be delegated but accountability cannot. There will certainly be overlap, but a production manager, for example, cannot make a supervisor solely accountable for the performance of an assembly line. Never blame a subordinate for something you are accountable for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, understanding the relationship between accountability and authority is essential for effective leadership. Leaders need to balance the use of their authority with accountability for their actions and decisions. Accountability and authority are interdependent concepts, and having one without the other can lead to frustration and negative outcomes. Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority, are mindful of the impact of their decisions on others, and are willing to take ownership of the outcomes of their actions. Leaders who embrace the philosophy of &amp;quot;The buck stops here&amp;quot; take responsibility for the consequences of their decisions and actions and are more likely to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;form&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/form&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>
      <LocationSummary>The relationship between accountability and authority is crucial for effective leadership. Accountability refers to responsibility for actions and decisions, while authority refers to the power or right to make decisions and take action. Accountability and authority go hand in hand, but accountability without authority can be frustrating. Effective leaders understand the limits of their authority and take ownership of outcomes. Project leaders should be aware of the challenge their team faces with new levels of accountability and authority and provide specific coaching. Accountability cannot be delegated, and leaders should not blame subordinates for their own accountability</LocationSummary>

&lt;blockquote&gt;Project Mechanics is focused on helping businesses with integrated and distributed web publishing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;#39;s web, you have a &lt;strong&gt;virtually unlimited number&lt;/strong&gt; of options on how to publish your content. &amp;nbsp; Without a plan, you can easily end up with isolated islands of content. &amp;nbsp; The challenge of today&amp;#39;s web is to create an integrated stream of distributed content. &amp;nbsp; Each stream needs to reinforce your core brand message. &amp;nbsp; Your website should be the hub that integrates the various streams into a unified experience.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Web publishing is accomplished through web content management software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A web content management system (CMS) is a software application that allows users to create, manage, and publish content on a website. CMSs are widely used by businesses, organizations, and individuals to create and maintain their own websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing a CMS, it is important to consider the specific needs and requirements of your website. Some key factors to consider include the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The size and complexity of your website: If your website is small and simple, with just a few pages and limited functionality, you may be able to use a basic CMS. However, if your website is large and complex, with multiple users and extensive functionality, you may need a more powerful and flexible CMS.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The type of content you will be managing: Different CMSs are better suited to different types of content. For example, if your website will feature a lot of images and videos, you may want to choose a CMS that offers robust media management capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The level of customization you need: Some CMSs offer a wide range of customization options, allowing users to tailor the look and feel of their website to their specific needs. Others are more limited in their customization options.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;The level of support and resources available: When choosing a CMS, it is important to consider the level of support and resources available, such as documentation, forums, and online communities. This can be particularly important if you are new to using a CMS or are not familiar with web development.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have considered these factors, you can begin researching and comparing different CMSs to find the one that best meets your needs. You may want to try out a few different CMSs before making a decision, and it can be helpful to consult with other users and experts in the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, choosing the right CMS for your website is an important decision that will impact the success of your website. By considering your specific needs and requirements, and doing thorough research and comparison, you can choose a CMS that will help you to create and manage a successful website.&lt;/p&gt;</LocationBody>

      <Title>Project Quality Management: Why, What and How </Title>

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guides to Project Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Managing projects can be a daunting task. With so many moving parts, it can be difficult to keep track of all the tasks that need to be completed. A project checklist can help you stay organized and ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner. Here are some tips for creating a project checklist that will help you manage your projects more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Identify the Project Goals: Before you can create a project checklist, you need to identify the goals of the project. What is the purpose of the project? What are the desired outcomes? Having a clear understanding of the project goals will help you create a checklist that is tailored to the specific needs of the project.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Break Down the Tasks: Once you have identified the project goals, you can begin to break down the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve those goals. Make sure to include all the necessary steps, from start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prioritize the Tasks: Once you have identified all the tasks that need to be completed, you can begin to prioritize them. Which tasks are most important? Which tasks can be completed later? Prioritizing the tasks will help you stay focused and ensure that the most important tasks are completed first.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Assign Deadlines: Once you have identified and prioritized the tasks, you can begin to assign deadlines for each task. Make sure to give yourself enough time to complete each task, but don&amp;rsquo;t be too generous with the deadlines. Having deadlines will help you stay on track and ensure that the project is completed on time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Track Progress: As you work through the project, track your progress. This will help you stay organized and ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating a project checklist is an important part of managing projects. By following these tips, you can create a checklist that will help you stay organized and ensure that all tasks are completed in a timely manner. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When assigned a project, it is very important to quickly determine the current state of the project.&amp;nbsp; Projects rarely start when you do. Usually, there is a project life before you started that is critical to gaining a thorough understanding of the project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a project is assigned to you do not assume that all previous steps have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;strong&gt;project checklists&lt;/strong&gt; can serve as a guide to discovering what has been done, and more importantly, what has not been done on a project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;Every project should have a place (physical binder,&amp;nbsp;web site, word document, whatever)&amp;nbsp;which contains all the information&amp;nbsp;about the project. Not every item on this list is relevant for every project, but you as a project manager must make a conscious decision NOT to include it, just the process of evaluating the list can raise some issues about the project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While the primary purpose of this is to give new resouces and orientation to the project, it also serves as a valuable checklist for the project manager.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;So, when starting out to build a Web API with ASP.Net you first need to do some resarch on best practices and get an idea of how you are going to implment it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Background Research Links:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft API implementation guidance: &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-api-implementation"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/best-practices-api-implementation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling a Web API From a .NET Client (C#) :&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client"&gt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best practice for creating HttpClient and calling an API: &lt;a href="http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/111882/clean-call-api-from-client-with-good-practice"&gt;http://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/111882/clean-call-api-from-client-with-good-practice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complete Example for Error Handlers: &lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397417.aspx"&gt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397417.aspx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a generic asp.net error handling article, good background, not specific to API or MVC calling an API&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exception Handling in ASP.NET Web API Application: &lt;a href="https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/the-asp-net-web-api-exception-handling-pipeline-a-guided-tour/"&gt;https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/the-asp-net-web-api-exception-handling-pipeline-a-guided-tour/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is things we can do in the API to make our errors more meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;I recently found a project on sourceforge which is 100% java based and does a very good job of generating gantt charts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It uses an XML based file system to store all information on the project.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It allows you to work on one project at a time, but given the ease of use and extensive reporting features, it is worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://ganttproject.sourceforge.net/" target="_new"&gt;http://ganttproject.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;I still need to create the maintance screens and the ability for each user to customize which feeds appear on which pages. &lt;/P&gt;</ArticleBody>

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;Looking to solve the problem of having no search engine on this site, I have found Google Custom Search Engine.&amp;nbsp; With 2 steps, a site search was created.&amp;nbsp; You can now try it out by using the search box in the right column.&lt;br /&gt;
I used the technique that requires you to have 2 pages, one for the box and one for the results.&amp;nbsp; Instead of just one page for the box, I have placed it on every page.&amp;nbsp; The results page uses IFrames to return the results, along with some ads (no such thing as a free lunch).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</ArticleBody>

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;Based on the success of my &lt;a href="http://www.lakeclaibornehouse.com"&gt;Lake Claiborn House&lt;/a&gt; site to sell our lake house, I have added my profile to &lt;a href="http://www.zillow.com/profile/markhazleton"&gt;Zillow &lt;/a&gt;.  The opportunity for localized sites is increasing as search engines seek to find more relevant results for local searches.&amp;nbsp; This is a great opportunity to create a unique site that highlights not only your property, but the surrounding area as well. If you need to a site to market your house or property, I can help you bring buyers to your door.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created the following real estate based sites&lt;/p&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;I have added the ability to have multiple 'skins' for the web site.&amp;nbsp; I was inspired by some of the DHTML sites, including, &lt;a href="http://www.csszengarden.com"&gt;CSS Zen Garden&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which allows people to develop their own CSS files and upload them on the site.&amp;nbsp; Another site that is great for showing what can be done with DHTML is &lt;a href="http://www.dhtmlcentral.com/"&gt;DHTML Central&lt;/a&gt; (which is the home of CoolMenus).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out some of the 'skins' that this site can have by going to the &lt;a href="/runtime/skin_switch.aspx"&gt;skin switch page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These skins are achieved&amp;nbsp;by defining styles using CSS.&amp;nbsp; In addition, the Top and Bottom code for the site is also maintained.&amp;nbsp;The values are stored in a database and can be changed on the fly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="a20a616b-fb85-4d4f-b42f-a41764bb528b" ginger_software_uiphraseguid="8adfc96b-91f5-4999-b687-ce3c4cb4e6e6" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"&gt;Site&lt;/span&gt; components are added to the template using a custom tagging system.&amp;nbsp; This includes navigation, titles, and copyright notices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the templates use the more traditional method of nested tables to achieve the desired layout.&amp;nbsp; There are others which&amp;nbsp;is pure CSS using &amp;lt;span&amp;gt; and&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt; tags&amp;nbsp;instead of tables. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;I have started a soft launch of &lt;a href="http://www.codeplex.com/wpm" target="_blank"&gt;Web Project Mechanics (WPM) on Codeplex&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;I am taking the web content management system that I have used for many clients and turning it into a project, then I will evolve it into a product. &amp;nbsp;Right now, the source is a collection of requirments from many clients and projects. &amp;nbsp;I have been able to unify most of my clients onto the current version of the tool. &amp;nbsp;At this time there are over 100 sites runing WPM. &amp;nbsp;While not a fully-fleged product, the code base is over 4 years old and has been reworked numerous times. &amp;nbsp;The big challange now is to create a product from many successful projects. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Project Description&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Web Project Mechanics is a Dot.Net based Web Content Management system developed written in VB.Net using an access database. It is developed using vb.net&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project came about after I created many website for various companies and individuals. The goal was a system that would allow me to quickly create a website, and maintain it over time without have to touch the file system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached this project as a tool to create HTML pages from a database. I used templates as a way to separate content and presentation. I wanted to be able to swap skins of a site very quickly. My goal was to create a site that I could hand over to a non-technical user to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This application is currently being used by over 100 web sites. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application is currently being modified to be more of a packaged product. A formal release plan and product road map is currently under development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you would like to participate, please contact Mark.Hazleton@projectmechanics.com &lt;/p&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;I was able to get an invite to the new Yahoo meme service. Thanks to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/georgedearing"&gt;GeorgeDearing&lt;/a&gt; for the invite. For a detailed breakdown of the service I reccomend goiing to &lt;a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/yahoo_meme_hands-on_with_yahoos_twitter_clone.php" target="_blank"&gt;ReadWriteWeb&lt;/a&gt; for thier excellent review. &amp;nbsp; Here are a few of my early thoughts after a small amount of time with meme:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t Yahoo a little late to the party on this? &amp;nbsp;Seems like the micro-blogging attention is between Facebook and Twitter, with Facebook now in posissen of my favorite micro-bloggint tool FrieldFeed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When do we get back to usability over coolness. &amp;nbsp;Web application should not be like playing a game of Mist, &amp;quot;Hmmm. &amp;nbsp;I wonder what this does?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;One big win for meme over twitter is the better linking of posts/replies. &amp;nbsp;I have always wanted more of a threaded discussion so I can follow a converstaion more easily. &amp;nbsp; Nice to have that ability when I want it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;Friday is here.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Hope you didn&amp;#39;t get fooled too much yesterday. I got the new PC Magazine and I have been checking out the many sites listed on their &lt;a href="http://www.pcmag.com/category2/0,1738,7488,00.asp" target="_new"&gt;100 Best Undiscovered Web Sites&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spent&amp;nbsp; way too much time on the site reviews.&amp;nbsp; Here are the sites that I really liked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.musicplasma.com" target="_new"&gt;Musicplasma.com&lt;/a&gt; - Interesting interface, must say that I do not always agree with the&amp;nbsp;relative size of the artists, guess I&amp;#39;m too much of an independant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.filmaffinity.com" target="_new"&gt;FilmAffinity.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- Was really fun to rate a bunch of movies, found a few that I will need to see soon.&amp;nbsp; However, my &amp;quot;movie soulmates&amp;quot; are all from Spain; What does that mean?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.turnerclassicmovies.com" target="_new"&gt;TurnerClassicMovies.com&lt;/a&gt; - Great trailers and content, even though I have not been a watcher of the channel, I really liked the site.&lt;/li&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft SharePoint&lt;/strong&gt; is a popular web platform developed by Microsoft for small to large organizations. It is designed as a centralized replacement for multiple web applications and supports various combinations of enterprise website requirements. It is typically associated with web content management and document management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharePoint&amp;#39;s multi-purpose platform allows for the managing and provisioning of intranet portals, extranets and websites, document management and file management, collaboration spaces, social networking tools, enterprise search, business intelligence tooling, process/information integration, and third-party developed solutions. SharePoint can also be used as a web application development platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharePoint is designed to be highly scalable. It is capable of supporting multiple organizations on a single &amp;#39;server farm&amp;#39;. Microsoft provides SharePoint as a free product, it sells premium editions with additional integration and functionality, and it also provides SharePoint as a cloud computing solution as part of Office 365 and BPOS. The product is also often sold as a cloud solution by local third-party vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SharePoint provides various methods for the customization and configuration of web areas, all of which have granular governance configurations. Beyond basic page-editing, file-storing and custom design (&amp;#39;branding&amp;#39;) capabilities, one of the more prevalent forms of configuration is the ability to install third-party customizations called &amp;#39;web parts&amp;#39; (i.e. widgets/gadgets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft SharePoint has evolved significantly since its initial release in 2001. Initially designed as a platform for document management and collaboration, SharePoint has expanded to include a wide range of features and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant developments in SharePoint has been its integration with Microsoft Teams. Teams is a cloud-based collaboration and communication platform that allows users to chat, share files, and work on projects together in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the integration of SharePoint and Teams, users can access SharePoint content and features directly within Teams, making it easier to collaborate on documents and projects. This includes the ability to share and edit files, create and manage document libraries, and access and manage SharePoint sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The integration of SharePoint and Teams has also brought new capabilities to SharePoint, such as the ability to create and use custom apps and connectors within Teams. This allows users to customize their experience and integrate SharePoint with other applications and services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the evolution of SharePoint and its integration with Teams has provided users with a more powerful and flexible platform for collaboration and document management. By bringing together the capabilities of SharePoint and Teams, Microsoft has enabled users to work more efficiently and effectively on their projects and tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</ArticleBody>

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;While working on the template for this site (a never ending process), I came across the YUI Library.  It is a collection of javascript and css to help you create better structured websites. I was able to add the links to my template and clean up my own CSS stylesheet.  I have been pleased with the results, and plan to continue to modify my template to take advantage of all the library has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Yahoo! User Interface (YUI) Library&lt;/strong&gt; is a set of utilities and controls, written in JavaScript, for building richly interactive web applications using techniques such as DOM scripting, DHTML and AJAX. The YUI Library also includes several core CSS resources. All components in the YUI Library have been released as open source under a &lt;a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/license.txt"&gt;BSD license&lt;/a&gt; and are free for all uses.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;Project Mechanics recently completed an implementation of a Control Analysis Model (CAM).&amp;nbsp; Running inside a BEA AquaLogic&amp;reg; User Interaction Portal. The solution used &lt;a href="/resources/workflow/handysoft-bizflow.html" id="Handysoft" name="Handysoft BizFlow" title="Handysoft BizFlow"&gt;HandySoft BizFlow&lt;/a&gt; work engine to facilitate maintenance of policies and procedures. Once created, the policies and procedures were mapped to both internal and external best practice frameworks. This created the ability for users to view the complete policy and procedure library via multiple contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing a corporation&amp;#39;s processes and controls to both regulatory requirements and best practice frameworks is a key component of evaluating risk, process improvement and control automation. The ability to analyze the maturity of an organization from a process and control perspective is essential to developing a strategy to increase that level of maturity through the introduction of new technology solutions or new process sourcing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of evaluating enterprise risk should begin with creation of a clear baseline of the current process and control environment. Once defined, the baseline model is initially used to perform a &amp;quot;Gap Analysis&amp;quot; of an organization&amp;rsquo;s process and control hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most organizations rely on consultants, after many hours of interviews, analysis and data entry, to build complex spreadsheets that are used for process and control analysis. In order to manage risk, executives need the ability to define a clear process and control strategy for their enterprise. This model will provide just that capability. Utilizing an advanced control analysis model, the team can rapidly analyze the process and control hierarchy and complete the initial gap analysis process. The analysis will be driven by risk management, leading practices and business requirements that are relevant to your organization&lt;/p&gt;</ArticleBody>

      <ArticleBody>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.dearinggroup.com"&gt;The Dearing Group&lt;/a&gt; is dynamic marketing and new media communications&amp;nbsp;company.&amp;nbsp; They help companies weave the internet and web 2.0 technologies into traditional marketing programs to create better customer experiences, increase sales, and expand web visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their clients ask them to do a lot of things.&amp;nbsp; Whether it be marketing, web strategy or support for a difficult project.&amp;nbsp; It's safe to say most of the Dearing Group projects have a web component, involve social media&amp;nbsp; and consistently push the marketing envelope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dearing Group needed a web presence to serve as a hub for their distributed web content.&amp;nbsp; They publish on several blogs and other social media sites.&amp;nbsp; They needed a way to bring all their content under a single unified brand.&amp;nbsp; Project Mechanics Web Services provided a platform to consolidate content from different sources including Blogs, Twitter, De.licio.us, Flickr, and Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result was a site that not only highlighted the many actives of the Dearing Group but also demonstrates how hyper-publishing can be used to get your message out to the public, while maintaining a strong brand stratgey that reinforces rather than dilutes the brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workflow&lt;/strong&gt; at its simplest is the movement of tasks through defined process. More specifically, workflow is the operational aspect of a work procedure: how tasks are structured, who performs them, what their relative order is, how they are synchronized, how information flows to support the tasks and how tasks are being tracked. As the dimension of time is considered in Workflow, Workflow considers &amp;quot;throughput&amp;quot; as a distinct measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Workflow Application is where various applications, components and people must be involved in the processing of data to complete an instance of a process. For example, consider a purchase order that moves through various departments for authorization and eventual purchase. The orders may be treated as messages, which are put into various queues for processing. A workflow process involves constant change and update. You can introduce new components into the operation without changing any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the concept of &lt;strong&gt;workflow&lt;/strong&gt; is not specific to information technology, support for workflow is an integral part of any application that processes information across a defined series of steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distinction can be made between &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;business&amp;quot; workflow paradigms. While the former is mostly concerned with throughput of data through various algorithms, applications and services, the latter concentrates on scheduling task executions, including dependencies which are not necessarily data-driven and may include human agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientific workflows found wide acceptance in the fields of bioinformatics and cheminformatics in the early 2000s, where they successfully met the need for multiple interconnected tools, handling of multiple data formats and large data quantities. Also, the paradigm of scientific workflows was close to the well-established tradition of Perl scripting in life-science research organizations, so this adoption represented a natural step forward towards a more structured infrastructure setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business workflows &lt;/strong&gt;are more generic, being able to represent any structuring of tasks, and are equally applicable to task scheduling within a software application server and organizing a paper or electronic document trail within an organization. Their origins date back to the 1970s, when they were purely paper-based, and the principles from that period made the transition to modern IT infrastructure systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key driver to gain benefit from the understanding of the workflow process in a business context is that the throughput of the work stream path is modeled in such a way as to evaluate the efficiency of the flow route through internal silos with a view to increasing discrete control of uniquely identified business attributes and rules and reducing potential low efficiency drivers. Evaluation of resources, both physical and human is essential to evaluate hand off points and potential to create smoother transitions between tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a way of bridging the gap between the two, significant effort is being put into defining workflow patterns that can be used to compare and contrast different workflow engines across both of these domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, workflow techniques are appropriate only for work in which human involvement is limited to key data entry and decision points. For innovative, adaptive, collaborative human work the techniques of Human Interaction Management are required.&lt;/p&gt;</ArticleBody>
