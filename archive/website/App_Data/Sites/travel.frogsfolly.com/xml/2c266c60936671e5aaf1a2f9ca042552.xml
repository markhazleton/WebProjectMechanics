&lt;p&gt;The Seafarer, written by Conor McPherson and directed by Ian Higham&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s Christmas Eve and Sharky has returned to Dublin to look after his blind brother, Richard. As the two men rattle around their old house, they are joined by local layabouts Ivan and Nicky –– and a stranger, new to town, the mysterious Mr Lockhart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over a night fuelled by alcohol and resentment, a game of cards is on the table. But the cost of losing may be higher than anyone imagines…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Conor McPherson, award-winning author of &#039;The Weir&#039; and &#039;Girl from the North Country&#039;, comes a blackly funny, haunting tale of family and friendship, steeped in whiskey and stirred by regret and the need for redemption.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seafarer, written by Conor McPherson and directed by Ian Higham&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s Christmas Eve and Sharky has returned to Dublin to look after his blind brother, Richard. As the two men rattle around their old house, they are joined by local layabouts Ivan and Nicky –– and a stranger, new to town, the mysterious Mr Lockhart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over a night fuelled by alcohol and resentment, a game of cards is on the table. But the cost of losing may be higher than anyone imagines…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Conor McPherson, award-winning author of &#039;The Weir&#039; and &#039;Girl from the North Country&#039;, comes a blackly funny, haunting tale of family and friendship, steeped in whiskey and stirred by regret and the need for redemption.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Seafarer, written by Conor McPherson and directed by Ian Higham&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It&#039;s Christmas Eve and Sharky has returned to Dublin to look after his blind brother, Richard. As the two men rattle around their old house, they are joined by local layabouts Ivan and Nicky –– and a stranger, new to town, the mysterious Mr Lockhart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Over a night fuelled by alcohol and resentment, a game of cards is on the table. But the cost of losing may be higher than anyone imagines…&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From Conor McPherson, award-winning author of &#039;The Weir&#039; and &#039;Girl from the North Country&#039;, comes a blackly funny, haunting tale of family and friendship, steeped in whiskey and stirred by regret and the need for redemption.&lt;br /&gt;
