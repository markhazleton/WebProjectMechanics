## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Overview

This command updates an **existing** pull request description based on the current state of the branch. Unlike `/devspark.create-pr`, which is designed for initial PR creation and prompts for full context, `update-pr` focuses on the branch delta since the last review — rebuilding the PR body without re-prompting for work items or context already captured in the existing PR.

**IMPORTANT**: This command **only updates the PR description** — it does not merge, approve, or modify code.

**Use this command when**:

- You have addressed review feedback and want to update the PR description to reflect what changed
- You want to refresh the PR body after a rebase or additional commits
- You want to regenerate the PR description without losing linked issues or work items

**Use `/devspark.create-pr` instead when**:

- No PR exists yet for the branch
- You want to start fresh with a new PR description

## Prerequisites

- Project constitution at `/.documentation/memory/constitution.md` (REQUIRED)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated (required)
- An existing open PR for the current branch
- **HARD RULE — Branch Sync**: The source (head) branch **MUST** be fully in sync with the target (base) branch. Do **NOT** proceed if the source branch is behind the target. Instruct the user to rebase or merge first.

## Outline

### 1. Initialize PR Context

Run `{SCRIPT}` and parse its JSON output for:

- `PR_CONTEXT`: Current PR metadata (number, title, branches, commit SHA, files, diff)
- `CONSTITUTION_PATH`: Path to constitution file
- PR body (existing description)
- Linked issues / work items referenced in the existing PR body

**PR Number Detection**:
Detect the PR number in this order:

1. User explicitly provides PR number in arguments: `#123` or `123`
2. GitHub environment variables: `GITHUB_PR_NUMBER`, `PR_NUMBER`
3. Current branch PR detection via `gh pr view`
4. If unable to detect, error with clear instructions

**Error Handling**:
If the script fails:

- **PR not found**: Suggest `/devspark.create-pr` to create a new PR
- **Branch out of sync** (`is_behind_target: true`): **STOP immediately.**
  > "BLOCKED: The source branch `{source_branch}` is behind target branch `{target_branch}`. Sync it first before updating this PR."
  > Suggested fix: `gh pr update-branch {PR_NUMBER}` or `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/{target_branch}`
- **Constitution missing**: Guide user to run `/devspark.constitution`
- **GitHub CLI not installed**: Provide installation instructions

### 2. Load Existing PR Metadata

Read the current PR body using `gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json body,title,labels,milestone,assignees`:

1. **Extract linked work items**: Identify all issue/ticket references (e.g., `Closes #45`, `Fixes #102`, `AB#1234`, `Resolves #67`) — these **must be preserved** in the updated PR body verbatim
2. **Extract existing title**: Use unless user provides a new title in arguments
3. **Note existing labels, milestone, and assignees** — these are not changed by this command
4. **Identify existing PR template sections** used in the current body

### 3. Compute Branch Delta

Determine what changed since the last commit SHA recorded in the PR review file (if one exists at `/.documentation/specs/pr-review/pr-{PR_NUMBER}.md`) or since PR creation.

**Finding the baseline commit SHA** (in order of preference):

1. Parse the `**Reviewed Commit**:` metadata line in the PR review file — use as the baseline if present
2. If the review file exists but contains no commit SHA (e.g., malformed or manually edited), fall back to the PR's first commit via `gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json commits --jq '.commits[0].oid'`
3. If no review file exists, use the PR creation commit (the base of the branch)

```bash
gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid'
```

Using the delta:

- List new commits added since the last review or PR creation
- Summarize new files changed, lines added/removed
- Identify the intent of changes (from commit messages and diff)
- Note any spec or task completions reflected in the new commits

### 4. Load Constitution for PR Template Context

Read `/.documentation/memory/constitution.md` to identify:

- Required PR checklist items from constitution principles
- Mandatory sections for the project's PR template
- Any PR-specific governance requirements

### 5. Detect PR Template

Check for an existing PR template in order:

1. `.github/pull_request_template.md`
2. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
3. `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/*.md` (select the most relevant)
4. If none found, use the default DevSpark PR structure

### 6. Rebuild PR Body

Construct the updated PR body by:

1. **Preserve all linked work items** from step 2 exactly as found (do not rephrase or remove)
2. **Update the summary section** to reflect the current branch state and highlight new changes since last review
3. **Update the "Changes in this PR" section** with the branch delta from step 3
4. **Regenerate the checklist** from the constitution and PR template — pre-check items that are clearly satisfied by the current diff
5. **Update spec lifecycle status** if the branch maps to a spec (`/.documentation/specs/{feature}/`)
6. **Add a "Changes since last review" subsection** if a review file exists, listing what was addressed

**Do not re-prompt the user** for any information already captured in the existing PR. If critical information is missing (e.g., the PR has no description at all), add a single focused question.

### 7. Update the PR on GitHub

Apply the updated body using:

```bash
gh pr edit {PR_NUMBER} --body "{UPDATED_BODY}"
```

Do not change the title, labels, milestone, or assignees unless the user explicitly requested changes in their input arguments.

### 8. Output Summary to User

Display a concise summary:

```text
✅ PR #{NUMBER} Updated!

📄 PR: {PR_TITLE}
🔗 URL: {PR_URL}
🔍 Branch delta: {N} new commits since last review
📋 Linked work items preserved: {LIST}

What changed in this update:
- [Summary of new changes incorporated]

To re-review after this update:
/devspark.pr-review #{NUMBER} re-review
```

## Guidelines

### Preservation First

The primary rule of `update-pr` is **preserve existing metadata**. Linked issues, milestones, labels, and assignees must not be altered. When in doubt, keep the existing value.

### Delta-Focused Summary

The PR body update should clearly communicate **what changed since the last version** in addition to the full current state. A reader who saw the previous version should immediately understand what is new.

### No Re-Prompting

This command is designed for iterative, low-friction use. If the existing PR already has a description, do not ask the user to re-describe the feature. Only ask for missing information that is strictly required (e.g., PR is completely empty and no spec exists).

### Constitution Compliance

The PR checklist must reflect current constitution principles. Pre-check items when the diff clearly satisfies them. Leave items unchecked when the diff does not address them — do not remove checklist items even if they seem inapplicable.
